"This is so cool. It's like, 'would you want your mother to read this??' Really great idea, well done!",0
"Thank you!! This would make my life a lot less anxiety-inducing. Keep it up, and don't let anyone get in your way!",0
This is such an urgent design problem; kudos to you for taking it on. Very impressive!,0
Is this something I'll be able to install on my site? When will you be releasing it?,0
haha you guys are a bunch of losers.,1
ur a sh*tty comment.,1
hahahahahahahahhha suck it.,0
FFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU,0
The ranchers seem motivated by mostly by greed; no one should have the right to allow their animals destroy public land.,0
It was a great show. Not a combo I'd of expected to be good together but it was.,0
"Wow, that sounds great.",0
"This is a great story. Man. I wonder if the person who yelled ""shut the fuck up!"" at him ever heard it.",0
This seems like a step in the right direction.,0
"It's ridiculous that these guys are being called ""protesters"". Being armed is a threat of violence, which makes them terrorists.",1
"This story gets more ridiculous by the hour! And, I love that people are sending these guys dildos in the mail now. But… if they really think there's a happy ending in this for any of them, I think they're even more deluded than all of the jokes about them assume.",1
"I agree; I don't want to grant them the legitimacy of protestors. They're greedy, small-minded people who somehow seem to share the mass delusion that this is not only a good idea for themselves as individuals, but is the right thing to do for ranchers at large. Basically: take something that currently belongs to everyone, and give it to a select group of people, so they can profit.",0
Interesting. I'll be curious to see how this works out. I often refrain from commenting because I don't have the time or desire to engage with the couple of resident trolls who seem to jump on every active WW comment thread.,0
Awesome! I love Civil Comments!,0
"I'm glad you're working on this, and I look forward to seeing how it plays out.    The comments sections of online news stories have the potential to be great tools for community interaction about current events, a Neo Town Hall, of sorts.  One of the reasons I rely on Reddit as a platform for news and local discussions is that there's a sense of community interaction that's often lacking in my ""real life,"" hectic discussions.    But hopefully we won't be tempted to silence those who take unpopular stances.",0
"Angry trolls, misogynists and Racists"", oh my. It doesn't take all of my 150 IQ to see the slant here.  it's the ""Diversity diode"" at work yet again. ""We can say anything that we want because we are Diversity. You on the other hand must only  say what we allow you to say. From now on, winning arguments against any member of diversity will be considered offensive language.  facts, cogent, linear posts and Math are now verboten.",1
Nice to some attempts to try to make comments better—it feels like any innovation in commenting communities ended with the launch of Disqus nearly a decade ago.,0
"One would hope that the purpose of introducing this system is to encourage more debate and discussion, not less.  It seems there are several things that limit the flow of discussion:  Making comments that are personal attacks or encouraging witch hunts; true spam (which has been a real problem on WW's comment section, in my experience); and chasing rabbits to draw discussions away from the primary subject at hand.  I, for one, don't want to see unpopular opinions silenced.  Healthy debate is an important component of a civil society.  But when discussions degenerate into insults and distraction, it actually limits the ability of people to talk with each other.  I'm believing that this is the intention of your newspaper here, and I hope it's a movement that results in more, not less, commentary on current events.  We need it.",0
"Comments will be randomly chosen and be reviewed by more than one person. But I bet the Civil people have an even better, more thorough answer to this question!",0
She would be a major improvement for city council and she has a long history of giving all citizens a voice. She is a problem solver that is what Portland needs .,0
"I agree! Comments have so much potential to be places for active discussion, especially in publications that already serve an amazing community (but then, I'm biased—I'm a Civil co-founder). We've worked hard to make sure that the comments section won't become an echo chamber, though, by combining clever algorithms on the backend with the peer reviews. That's also why there are two separate questions: ""is this a *good* comment?"" and ""is this comment civil?""",0
"Great question! It's one we're asked a lot. We've designed the system assuming that people *will* try to abuse it. So, in addition to the peer reviews, there are algorithms on the backend doing a lot of meta-analysis. I'm sure the system isn't 100% perfect yet, but we know from months of beta testing that it's a really solid start, and we'll keep working to improve it!",0
"Thanks, Christa!  Will you be adding any features to allow overall ""upvotes"" of the article itself?  Also, notification settings for users?",0
"Our aim is actually the opposite: we want spirited debate in which everyone feels free to participate, without fear of harassment, abuse, or death threats. Right now, a lot of voices are being silenced due to that fear. We designed Civil Comments for civil, respectful discussion and debate—we don't want it to become a ""positive comments only"" echo chamber. There's a lot going on on the backend to prevent abuse of the system. So, everyone is free to speak their mind, even if their opinion is unpopular—so long as they treat each other with respect.",0
"Thanks! We're really going to try — not only to improve civility, but also to make comments more dynamic and interesting.",0
I applaud Civil's efforts to create some new technology in this field. Hoping for more thoughtful discussions moving forward.,0
Why bother writing a review if it's going to be this devoid of content?  I understand that you work for WW. (but that hardly seems like an excuse when Fred Armisen recorded radio voices for Grand Theft Auto IV with the same number of people.),0
Yet call out all Muslims for the acts of a few will get you pilloried.   So why is it okay to smear an entire religion over these few idiots?  Or is this because it's okay to bash Christian sects?,1
"I love the idea of upvoting entire articles, though this would have to be something that the Publisher could turn on and off. We do have a ton of other features currently in the works—following (and blocking!) other users, bookmarking articles during the review process, to read later (I find myself wanting to read the articles that other people are commenting on, as I'm reviewing their comments!), following conversations, and so much more. Thanks for your enthusiasm, Melinda, and your patience! It's a brand-new way to approach comments, and we're going to continue to improve it. We welcome all suggestions and feedback!",0
Troll free since 2016.,0
This bitch is nuts. Who would read a book by a woman.,1
Awesome!,0
Not for long!    (Troll-In-Training since 2016),0
Commenting for the sake of commenting to rate other comments to better comment on our new comment system.,0
Interesting concept.  How does Civil Comments plan to monetize their operation?,0
"Pity the menu lost so much vegan food! The Mash Tun was a favorite beer bar for all the delicious tempeh stuff. Excited the staff is still there, can't wait to try the new beers.",0
"I already see dozens of ""just commenting to vote on comments to be able to comment"" type of comments.  This voting system is completely insane- you're assuming people have the extra time to *actually read* multiple non related comments?  I would love to see this system installed on oregonlive.com - they have enough online visitors and an established ""troll"" base to really need this service.  With as little online activity as wweek has - it will discourage further growth here.",0
Very cool project!,0
Awesome! Signed up just to give this a shot... good luck to your enterprise!,0
"disqus has way more functionality and obviously a huge following - it can increase visitor count significantly.  disqus also has a moderator feature - a feature that wweek either never wanted to pay their staff to undertake, or never developed a group of people they could trust to do it on their behalf on a volunteer basis.",0
"YET ANOTHER BARACK OBAMA LIBERAL MEDIA CONSPIRACY BY THE THOUGHT CONTROL POLICE. I DIDENT SPEND 30 YEARS MIXING CONCRETE TO LET AMERICA FALL TO THE COMMIES. THE TAXES HERE ARE SO HIGH I CANT EVEN AFFORD A KEYBOARD WITH A WORKING CAPS LOCK. PORTLAND HAS BEEN GOING DOWNHILL FOR YEARS, NO WONDER THE TEA PARTY IS MAKING A COMEBACK. WHATS NEXT FLOURAIDE IN THE WATER SUPPLY?",0
I haven't seen the kind of comments you're mentioning. I'm interested in where this system works and where it's having problems. Do you have a link you could share that has comments like you mentioned?,0
I'm crazy about that illustration! I never would have thought to pitch everything so yellow and orange.,0
"wmcelha, there are several new and exciting vegan and gluten free options on the new menu!  Buffalo tostones are a fun, vegan, gluten free, soy free option.  Not to mention a killer new veggie burger, vegan tacos, and several nice salads.  Hope to see you there soon!",0
"Thank you, thank you, thank you! I love WW content but the comment section has polluted for far too long. The lack of community moderation gave a loud megaphone to a small number of right wing trolls.",0
Probably because they consistently waste funds on trendy projects like green bike boxes -- which cost a fortune and have to be repainted every couple of years.  Oy.,0
"The system is set up so if traffic is slow, an algorithm takes over until it picks up.",0
Because the people who drive cars more are the ones who cause more wear and tear on the roads?  Pretty fair and straightforward.,0
"Affordable housing gets built pursuant to tax #3, immediately becomes less affordable pursuant to tax #2.  Brilliant!",0
"Tried this out on another post.  Having to rate three other comments and then my own - is the lead designer a big Foucault fan?  Feels like panopticomments.  I suspect you won't go back, but I prefer Disqus because of the ubiquity and notifications system.",0
"""winning arguments against any member of diversity""  You may have inadvertently given Civil Comments an idea for the 2.0 version of their system.  1. Is this a good comment?  2. Is this comment civil?  3. Did this comment totally just win the argument???",0
"I had a little trouble getting signed up, but after a brief email exchange with the folks at Civil everything appears to be working now.  If they're successful in their goal, I'll be extremely pleased.",0
"Are you taxed as a resident of the state you were in when you bought the ticket, or as a resident of the state you are in when you claim the ticket?

"The letter writing campaign to get livestock off of Malheur Refuge started in the late '70's. The death threat phoned in to Nancy and Denzel's home was in 1979; along with two other friends I was hired a bodyguard to help protect N&D that weekend. The Hammond's ejection of the Ferguson's from the Diamond Dance was the year or two before the death threat. Great article WW and Jim D. For the last 10 days, lots of us have been wishing we could hear Denzel make witty quips about the Bundycon's occupation of the refuge hq. Sacred Cows at the public trough is easy to get on Amazon. Read and learn, read and learn ... great history of western livestock abuses ...",0

"Send more dildos, STAT.",0
"I've been loosely following Civil Comments since it was announced late last year; I even tried a beta demonstration. One thing I've been wondering is: will users will have to sign up for new profiles on any site that uses Civil, or do you have one Civil profile that you'd use on any partner site?",0
My sign-up just now couldn't have been smoother!,0
"I couldn't be more pleased. Comments on many sites too often get overtaken by trolls. It's the first I've heard of Civil, but I like its intent and encourage other publications in town to consider comments as a platform for engagement rather than a troll-driven click driver intended to boost online ad rates.",0
"Thanks so much for following our progress and helping to test the software, David! To answer your question: you'll have one over-arching Civil account where you can manage different profiles for different sites. Of course, you're welcome to use the same information across all sites! We decided that it'd be best to be able to present yourself differently to different communities, though. I might, for example, want to be portland_hipster15 here on Willamette Week, but prefer to be MrWhiskers on Cat Enthusiast Digest!",0
"Enterprise licenses are available now, and we'll have tiered small business plans available very soon! We will also have a free, public version out later this year.",0
"This is certainly not good journalism by any stretch of the imagination, but they are words, and if this is the metric by which Willamette Week chooses to publish a journalist, then by all means publish Brace Belden.",0
"This was completely fascinating. But it left me with a question I haven't seen reported elsewhere either: These guys identify as ranchers, so who are their customers? What are the economics of their situation -- are they in the same situation as chicken farmers, where they have had their livelihoods squeezed away ... I'd like to understand what drives someone who seems to have so much to be so alienated, and their economic situation must play into that.",0
"Thanks so much for your input, and for giving us a chance! We do have user following (and blocking!) as well as more notifications in the works for future versions. I hope you'll stick around and let us know what you think! And yes, the software architect, Aja, is a Foucault fan.",0
I think you left out one very important organization who help the mentally ill over 18. NAMI Multnomah. They help people with mental distress find within or without NAMI to find them the services that can be most beneficial to them.  I am a volunteer for NAMI Multnomah in their Connection program. It is a walk-in group to people 18 and up. No matter the diagnosis we welcome them and help them learn new coping skills and develop tools to further  help them learn to cope from week to week. We have groups all over Multnomah County. By going  to http://nami.multnomah.org/. You will with out much difficulty find the list of Connection Groups and their times and locations.,0
"Thanks for the info! One other thing I just noticed: in the email I got about your reply, the link to view it didn't work (at least not from Mail.app on OS X). Looks like it came through as x-webdoc:// and probably doesn't know how to deal with that scheme.  Really love what you're doing with Civil Comments, though! Can't wait to see it on more sites. Might even bring back comments on my personal site once it's available!",0
Interesting idea. I tend to use content blockers on sites that I know don't moderate comments very well. If they adopted a system like this I might stop doing that.,0
This was quite a comprehensive list. Goody for the writers and the people that researched for this guide.,0
"Ryan Bundy seems like a nice, responsible  human being who has been sold a bill of goods by his  intellectually domineering brother, who he idolizes.

Personally, I am glad these bearded, cammo wearing, narrowly educated , nuisances....are there and not here. Traffic is bad enough.  No reason to make it worse with a Constitutional Pagent Play in the Federal Building in downtown PDX.

"All the framed boxes must take up extra code and bandwidth usage to send all the extra code to our browsers..  Then there is all the ""2 more replies"" buttons to click on - that is amazingly annoying - I don't want to have to click on half a dozen ""more replies"" buttons to see what is being said.  And really, you have to vote on 3 other replies? What percentage of your users wait more than 1/2 second before randomly clicking on a response? Oh well, I digress.",0
"Ah, so part of the ""back end"" and ""algorithms"" - automatic comment rejection if you don't vote on the 3 random comments in a way that is conforming enough to the way other users vote - or if you vote too fast, as I assumed many would do - just clicking a random button too quickly means that you're unwilling to ""participate"" - you just want to ""comment"" which doesn't ensure a ""civil"" community of commenters :  Screen grab from a rejected comment : i5guy 3 hours ago Rejected Personally, I already don’t have the time or energy to actually read the stuff they ask me to vote on.

"Thanks, David! And yes, that's a known issue, new to installing on WW. Working on it! :)",0

"I think Wweek is in a strange spot with that.  Their comments can be active, but they're nowhere near as busy as say, OregonLive.  Forcing the writers or other staff to monitor comments might be overkill.  I definitely get a newspaper not wanting outsiders handling that, for fear of confusion and accusations of bias.  It seems like every OregonLive comment thread has accusations of bias due to deleted posts despite repeated insistence that comment moderation is not handled in-house.  I've also seen several communities where conforming to the political view is more of a metric for desirability than anything to do with tone or actual content, and mods reinforced that.  The results of volunteers may....vary, to be polite.",0
"I saw @christa_m mention this a little below, but I'm curious how the system combats the echo chamber effect, especially on contentious issues?  I can imagine many stories where opinions which run against the (Portland) mainstream are viewed as inherently uncivil, such as supporting Trump's position on...well pretty much anyone that isn't white, or say supporting the Kleins in the Sweet Cakes by Melissa saga.

The posts that challenge conventional wisdom yet aren't civil won't hit the thread, and, sure, some folks will always try and scam the system by not allowing comments that they disagree with thru, but I wouldn't be surprised if many of the folks that take that approach when reviewing comments are the same ones who are having comments denied for being uncivil.  If that's the case it may be somewhat of a self-correcting problem, where they become bored with not having any comments post and go elsewhere.  I'm just speculating however only time will tell. I also would not be surprised if I was totally off base on all of this.",0
Nice. :) Although it's a shame the resolution on the files make some of the lettering tough to read. I'm not sure what the last word in the lower right strip is. I like the design of the 2000s guy in the third strip. That's a guy who grew up watching Kevin Smith movies.,0
"If it is effective in slowing us down in order to reflect upon how we engage with others and draws attention to the humanity of each recipient, then I approve.",0
"Hi David, we did consider all of these possibilities when building our system! In fact, we assume people will try to game it; that's why we have a lot going on behind the scenes algorithmically. The commenter-facing part of the app is very straightforward, but there are a lot of checks and balances on the backend to prevent coordinated attacks and also to keep comments sections from becoming echo chambers. Banning insulting words isn't enough, unfortunately; people will always be smarter than word filters, even if the algorithm tries to take context into account. We do have a backup algorithm for low-volume situations that basically does this (plus a few other things), but it's not as effective as human reviewers.

For example, if folks are sorting the comments by what's most popular (which is a handy feature) and there isn't a way to truncate the replies, everyone who replies to the top-most comment has their post appear above everyone else who simply posts to the main thread. Something like this:   1.

Poverty doesn't make people more skilled in the arts.  Why should low income students have priority?  Also before other commenters jump the gun; I believe everyone should absolutely have access to free public education all the way through postgrad.,0
"""Locke also noted that the teacher has given the ungraded and popular assignment for 20 years, that being an art-focused school means da Vinci often has unconventional hands-on approaches to assignments, and that students still will be tested more traditionally on their geography lessons.""  Hear hear. The only teachers I remember from school, who taught me the most, were the ones willing to go out on a limb and do creative stuff like this. And that joke about the whole-wheat cruelty free ingredients totally got lost in translation. Kudos to the principal for allowing a sense of humor!",0

"Ugh... we're a state for a reason. Don't start making special laws for special parts of the state, not big ones like this.",0
"Low-income kids should have priority because they start out so extremely disadvantaged when compared even to lower-middle-class kids. Giving them priority in programs like this helps to raise some of them up to the starting point of other kids. For example, David Bowie and Alan Rickman, two amazing creative artists we lost this week, both benefited from government-funded arts educations that their parents otherwise would never have been able to afford! Because they were able to go to art school for free, though, they bettered their own lives. And the rest of the world benefitted from their work!",0
"And now I'm super hungry… for Africa? This is a weird and cool idea! The kids will spend a LOT of time thinking about what they could use for the various geographical features, and I bet they'll never forget it!",0

"Haven't been to Tastebud's new location, but good on them for throwing a bone (crust?) to SW. Their pizza game is strong. SE Portland is fully saturated in great pizza, though I'm sad Pizza Maria closed. It was fantastic. But here's what I wonder: with all of this genuinely great pizza to be had on and around SE Division (I'd go to P.R.E.A.M. or Apizza Scholls every day if I could, and Cibo is excellent, as is Roman Candle, though a completely different style), how do places like Atlas Pizza survive? Atlas Pizza should not still exist by all the laws of gods and men, and yet. AND YET. Anyway 🍕🍕🍕",0

Is there any indication that Bowie or Rickman got special consideration or were they talented already?  I don't think just allowing someone into an institution because they are socioeconomically disadvantaged is going to help anyone.  Maybe they should have their own institution specific to their own problems.,0
"They were talented, but neither would have had access to art school without government funding. Giving low-income kids priority doesn't limit other kids, who have plenty of enrichment opportunities (including the same government-funded ones!) As for ""their own institutions"", sorry but that sounds like segregation! Studies show that lower income kids benefit from going to school with higher income kids (reflects positively in test scores and behavior!)",0
"It's truly a golden age of pizza in Portland. I went to Tastebud a few times when it was on Milwaukie; the pizza was excellent, but that space was a little weird. Very cramped and dark.  Meanwhile: Apizza Scholls got new ovens and they're now offering calzones and bread!",0
"This is a fantastic idea assignment. Kids will have to think about each country and landscape. Many schools just use rote memorization rather than something that will ""stick"" with the kiddos. WW, by calling this out, are you making some claim against this assignment?

The foster care system has been broken for more than 40 yrs.  It is not that the caseworkers don't care but they are overwhelmed by a system that is driven by the Title IV-e funding.  If the use of the Differential Response Module were used and the attempt to preserve the family less foster beds would be needed and fewer children would be traumatized by a radical removal from not only their homes but everything they know if their lives.

I think Kate Brown should move forward and implement this proposal as it would help improve the economy of Oregon.,0
"Yeah, it's going to be really hard for her to do anything even remotely public at this point. But it's worth considering that the magazine might specifically want her on staff to stir up interest and drive traffic? Cynical, yeah, but it's totally possible. I don't see it paying off long term.",0
"I don't think it sends much of a message to host these rallies in places like Portland and Eugene. Sure, easier to find more people friendly to the cause in these cities, but what point is it really making? I'm pro-public land and pro-wildlife refuge, but I don't see how this is going to help.",0
"While I was initially conflicted upon hearing this, the more I think about it the more I feel that having two separate min. wages isn't a good idea. While the idea of helping deal with cost of living in Portland is noble, this doesn't help anyone who may live there but work outside the ""Urban Growth Boundary"" for instance. Similarly, as Nick mentions, this may also incite people to live outside the boundary and pursue jobs within and on the other hand, some businesses, if given the option, may elect to open up or relocate outside the boundary in order to avoid the higher minimum wage.",0
"If they held the rally near Malheur, though, it'd draw more press coverage back, which is what they want. The press is starting to ignore them; let's not give them a reason to head back out there.",0

None of those things are conducive to furthering actual conversation or revealing ""ugly truths.""   Personal attacks, harassment, and death threats only silence people—either through fear or by forcing sites to turn off their comments entirely.  Spirited debate—even angry words!—are acceptable so long as they're respectful of other people. I hope you'll agree that mutual respect is a reasonable expectation for public discussion, even when negative emotions are involved.",0

"Good question, Jackie! How do these yokels make their money? Well, LaVoy Finicum just had his foster children taken from his ranch, likely as a result of him becoming a militant criminal likely to face a suite of federal felony charges. Some reports and tax filings from his home state suggest Finicum was receiving, some years, $100,000 from Catholic Charities to provide foster care. While - according to his statements to the media - his cows barely pay for ranch expenses, the money from the kids could presumably pay for his lifestyle (surely other state money also helped). Was he getting free labor from boys who could work with him on his ranch? Perhaps, but all we know is that with the loss of his foster kids, Finicum is sad to be losing his monetary income, and says he may have to go back to eating rice and beans now that he's not getting paid thousands a week to house, feed, and provide ample ranch work for foster kids.",0
"Am I missing something, because there's nothing about the ""free-range, organic, cruelty-free"" section that appeared to be joking, or have any self-deprecating self-awareness, which is what this whole deal hinges on. Are there any commenters who are going to call the supervisor on this obvious distortion?   I think this email-leaking parent did exactly the right thing. If a teacher has been assigning something like this for 20 years, there's no point in ""confronting her directly"". If her supervisor comes up with the line that defends her free-range, earth-friendly snobbery was ""a joke"", there's no reason to talk to anyone at the school about this assignment (clearly the entire administration sees the mind-numbing cognitive dissonance in labeling a cake full of sugar ""earth friendly"" and ""cruelty free""). Leak it to the WW, and see what happens: Lo and behold, suddenly the creativity-loving food snob changes her tune.  There's nothing wrong with advocating for creativity (though I personally am skeptical of elementary school creativity proselytizers). There's absolutely nothing wrong with using and advocating ""earth friendly"" and ""human healthy"" ingredients.  But a middle school teacher - even one who lives in Portland - has no credentials to know what these ingredients are, and no right to push parents of her students to make financial lifestyle decisions based on the teacher's personal moral stance on branding and labeling of chicken and wheat products. In any case, she's recommending they make cakes out of cookie or brownie or cake batters. The number 1 or 2 ingredient is going to be some form of sugar, which is probably the worst thing you could eat, health-wise, and ""plantation-consciousness""-wise, anyway.",0

Note how the FBI seems to think that the media and locals of Burns are the problem not the ""occupation"".  And it is a little unclear why the state police are not taking action and what about the Burns police department?  Ultimately the goal appears to be to create artificial conflicts among different citizens so that united beneficial cooperation is off the table in favor of violence and greater federal control.",0

"If you look up the statistics on ""maltreatment of children in foster care"" you'll see that no state has more than 1 or 2 total for the year. The reason is that the federal evaluations come down hard on agencies who have more than that. So, anytime they receive a complaint of abuse, they either ignore it or investigate and find no substantiation. You bet the agency serves its best interests and not the interests of the children. PDX Grandma is right. The state takes far too many children into custody and for frivolous reasons to get the federal funding that keeps the agency existence justified.

"Part 3 ballot measure It is the oldest zoo west of the Mississippi ; during its 50-year history at the current location, key parts of the Zoo have become old, out-of-date and worn out.  The Zoo bond measure will update and replace old exhibits and facilities, increase access to conservation education, and replace utility systems to reduce water and energy use and lower operating costs.  More Humane Conditions for Elephants Outdoor space will increase from 1.5 to 6 acres, adding watering holes, shade structures, large trees, and boulders, providing more outside exercise and offering a more natural environment.  Protecting the Health of Polar Bears Provide cooler temperatures and more humane conditions by removing concrete and adding land and pool space.  More Humane Enclosures for Apes and Monkeys A renovated exhibit will replace the current cage-like conditions with larger indoor and outdoor areas, adding running water and more natural conditions.",0
"Part 4 of ballot measure.  Dedicated Space for Conservation Education Replace two 12 year old modular trailers, a former storage space, a basement and leased off-site space with new presentation, classes and camp space for the over 100,000 children and adults attending annually.  Condors Provide an on-site Condor exhibit.  Protect Animal Health & Safety Replace the substandard 45-year old animal hospital and quarantine buildings with facilities meeting modern standards.",0
"I wasn't living in Portland in 2008, but have seen the taped statement of Metro councilmember Collette assuring an audience, prior to the vote, that an off-site preserve for the elephants would definitely be included in the zoo bond. Metro and the zoo are continuing to treat these animals as a commodity and profit generator.",0
"Part 5 of ballot measure  Save Water, Reduce Water Pollution, Improve Water Quality Since most of the zoo's pipes, plumbing and irrigation systems also date back to the 1950s and '60s, many are outdated, leaking and well past their useful lives. The most expensive utility cost at the 55-acre zoo is water, and leaking pipes, run-off, inadequate filtration systems, and lack of water storage all contribute to wasting water and increasing costs. Replacing the sewer system and separating sewage from storm water will reduce pollution, improve water quality and save costs. Adding modern water filtration and recycling systems to the hippo and penguin pools will save over 11,000,000 gallons of water every year.  That's all the relevant parts of the ballot measure. No mention of an elephant reserve. That's what was voted on.  Too bad WWEEK couldn't provide some level of in depth reporting, instead resorting to click bait.",0

They talked about a reserve repeatedly and the Humane Society endorsement in the voter pamphlet refers to it specifically because that is how metro sold it.

"Nick - I would be delighted if climate activists were showing up to argue for both density and housing affordability. Instead, they are mostly not showing up to the comprehensive plan hearings at all. Density, as Angus Duncan of the state climate change commission points out, is key to climate policy. If 7,00 people live within walking distance of each other, a grocery store will spring up to serve them that they can walk to, rather than drive. Density is critical to the viability of transit; the reason the New York subway system is economically viable is that there are a lot of people per stop. I think it's important for people who care about the climate to explain that to their fellow citizens. As to gentrification, cause gentrification; what causes gentrification is rich people moving here. If we built zero new housing, the rich people moving in would still drive up the price of the existing housing.",0

"Predatory patrol towing isn't a big subject, and there is no advocacy group that is paying any attention to it, but the City of Portland has completely backed off of enforcing state law where the towing predators are operating on private property, and this is Commissioner Novick's failure. He's in charge of towing.  The City has allowed Retriever Towing to operate in open violation of ADA for years at their NW Quimby lot, and there is absolutely no provision in city ordinance that takes into account when they tow a mobility-disabled person's vehicle.  Wheelchair or no wheelchair, the person has to get themselves to the tow yard (which does not have wheelchair access).  Led by Senator Avel Gordly, the legislature enacted important new citizen protections against predatory towing effective January 1, 2008, but there is no effective way for Portlanders to learn what their rights are other than what the predatory towers themselves tell you. A description of the protections has never appeared on the City website. The version posted there has never been correct.  It is only in the past two years the the City began enforcing the signage requirements, and the City Towing Coordinator worked with the towers to pass the costs onto the citizens. $ 20 of every tow bill goes to the towers to ""compensate"" them for their signs, with no upper limit, and your $ 20 is likely to be paying for signs completely unrelated to the place your vehicle was towed from.  Portland towers are allowed to operate in open violation of state law and the City's own statutes, providing towing services to property owners for free. That is specifically prohibited by state law and City ordinance.  Senator Gordly's legislation was intended to protect people living in apartment complexes, generally low-income, minority populations, and they have no one standing up for them in City Hall. I hope you are that champion.",0
"An elephant in a zoo is an animal exhibition in a sterile, unnatural environment. Artificial breeding is not natural. It is a tortuous procedure as tubes for insemination are forced up the female's reproductive tract. Elephants in zoos are prone to TB, hepatitis, joint and foot problems, and early deaths, not to mention boredom and depression of constricted movement.   In contrast, larger tracts of land in sanctuary allow elephants a more natural life.  It's a holistic approach to what the elephants need.  They are more apt to flourish and show off their gentle and playful personalities.  Visitors see an elephant more similar to those in the wild.  In sanctuary, it's a win-win for elephants and patrons alike! I have seen zoo elephants, and wild elephants in Africa.  It's disappointing that Metro is backing out of the reserve.",0

"There is an option that would be a better long term solution. Move the Spanish immersion program (SIP) from its location at Ainsworth to a currently unused facility like east Sylvan. This will open up room for 300 students at Ainsworth.  The overall PPS SIP is a great concept and espouses the goals of diversity, accessibility, and inclusion.  However, the SIP at Ainsworth is the dirty little secret of the Westside. It does not meet any of the above goals. There is no diversity, access is difficult, and it is run like an exclusive private school, funded by taxpayer money. Schools overcrowded? No problem, SIP is capped at 26 students per class. Lack of budget for teachers? Not an issue, SIP has assistant teachers for every class!    How is this even compatible with the PPS equity initiative?  Moving the Ainsworth SIP will help meet its true goals, but there is strong resistance to this because it would inconvenience some privileged families that live in the mansions close to the school.",0

"Were you around in 2007-08 when the bond measure was being debated? The zoo was repeatedly pitching the reserve to get people to support the bond, but the text did not go into the details. Tony Vechchio was the then-zoo director who went off to Florida as soon as the bond went to ballot, and the reserve was conveniently forgotten. If, as you say, the reserve was not in the bond measure text, perhaps you can explain why Metro wasted more than $100,000 in buying an option for the property in Roslyn lake?

"Ok, first of all, Star Trek came out before Star Wars. Two: Star Trek has vastly superior ships (shields, phasers, photon toroedeos) all much more powerful then the Star Wars destroyer. Not to mention the destroyer misses 29 out of 23 shots at close range when the ship is making no effort to maneuver from them. Star Trek ships also can reach higher speeds and go up to 9 times the speed of light.   Fights between the Republic and the Empire are complete junk as the Republic is always outgunned like 30 to 1 but still win. Star Trek also features a variety of episodes instead of always focusing on just poorly shooting each other. Not to mention the ""superior"" AT walker which not tripped by thin wires and the Death Star which had a huge tunnel to the reactor.   I don't see how anything of Star Wars is better (besides the aliens) then Star Trek. It's simple: if Star Trek and Star Wars fought a battle Star Trek would win.",0

"I always find the Star Wars/Star Trek debate funny because they seem so different to me that I have a hard time understanding how the two can be compared. Star Trek was created as a series of books and an episodic TV show, meaning that it was meant to have discreet stories told and wrapped up in a short time. Star Wars, on the other hand, was written as a series of movies with a far-reaching storyline. Star Trek is meant to be set in our own future, complete with our history and built upon our understanding of the real universe. Star Wars, however, exists ""a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away."" That opens SW up to potentially involve elements that would be too fantastical in a universe based on our own, no matter how futuristic. There are many other reasons, but fundamentally, comparing SW and ST does not seem like an appropriate comparison. (Also, if you insist on comparing them, it would probably be best to be done by someone with a reasonable degree of knowledge of both properties.)",0

"I'm not a big fan of either, but I've seen both, if you can count the first three Star Wars movies and a random smattering of different Star Trek episodes as having seen them.   Of course you have an apples and oranges problem in making the comparison, because the scope of the two projects – objectives, budgets, people involved, and all things creative – were so different. Trek was conceived to sell ads on network TV, right? Wars was a Lucas/Spielburg extravaganza. Sure, Trek became a series of movies too, but that was afterthought. So it bothers me that you cite history based on the movies with Star Wars first, when Star Trek actually started almost two decades earlier than Star Wars, in 1966, as a television show.   Production values, star power, effects, of course all go to Star Wars, and there is budget and objectives behind that. But Star Trek did start earlier, paved the way, and had a long history of different people involved, with an interesting flair for putting real human problems (racism, for example, a recurring theme in Star Trek as the different races dealt with each other) into a new perspective. And there's interesting comparisons on the big picture, too ... the great Yoda perspective and quotes, of course, and the whole power of the force, in Star Wars. But Trek embraced big picture too, like the larger collective metaphor of Seven of Nine.   I wish you'd done a straight compare and contrast, instead of which is better. Better will always be subjective, and it's too close ended, in my opinion.",0

"""What causes gentrification is rich people moving here."" Mr. Novick.  Kinda.  But there's more to the story: it is a city run by real estate interests where rules are not enforced, where the city refuses to control AirBnB and allows Vacasa to flout the tax laws.  It is tax compression in the inner Eastside. It is tax breaks and grants thrown at real estate investors.  It's out of state money buying apartments and upping the rent to cover the costs associated with flipping apartment buildings.  It is letting heavy construction equipment causing local streets to crumble while Prius owners get the blame and foot the bill.   I hope PDX does the right thing and elects Wheeler.

This just proves that we cannot trust our government to tell the truth. But we still need to hold them accountable for their statements to the public.  And since there was so much public outcry about the preserve, Metro did option land, did hold hearings to discuss the plans for the preserve and did target in 2008 $12 million for captital expenses and a feasibility study. So why claim it was never part of the bond? Because all the money was spent on the new exhibit? Or it was a ruse to fool the public about their real intentions to never provide a preserve.",0

"In the interest of understanding each other, I will include my comments as they were written for this article.  Hi Rachel,  In brief, I have quite a few concerns about the Commissioner's approach, namely that pursuing density without adequate protections in place to prevent displacement and invest in community stability for existing residents (in particular low-income renters, communities of color) puts us on the wrong path to being the next San Francisco where hardly anyone of modest income can afford to live. Our governments and the market have thus far failed to stem displacement in our rapidly gentrifying city, and we continue to lack the tools necessary to increase density in a way that accounts for displacement. I fear that the city of Portland will finally achieve a ""sustainable, equitable"" city, but only once the vast majority of low-income residents and communities of color are pushed outside the city limits. <continued in next comment.",0
"To my knowledge, the commissioner has yet to endorse Anti-Displacement PDX's 28 measures in the Comprehensive Plan. This is a crucial first step--but still just a first step--in giving the city the tools and underlying mandates necessary to better confront the problem. There's a long way to go in removing state-level pre-emptions on rent control, inclusionary zoning, and the minimum wage--all things that impact the ability of people to afford living in the city.   I am happy to talk more about this today over the phone, but would also be happy to field questions over email if that's easier.  All the best,  Adam",0
"I worry that pursuing density in the current market may be condemning us to repeat the same eco-apartheid we're already seeing--that's worsening--in inner Portland neighborhoods where sustainable, walkable, green neighborhoods are available exclusively to wealthier residents who can afford it.   From Rachel: ""Could you tell me what you think of that criticism from him -- that the local environmentalists aren't mobilizing on what's an important issue that would actually have an important impact locally?""  Me: ""I don't think that there is a consensus among local environmental groups about exactly how we should be increasing density. A lot of these neighbors who are dominating the comp plan hearings are complaining about the loss of mature trees, solar access, and the general character of their neighborhoods. I think a lot of environmentalists see density development driven by a market frenzy as sometimes inherently in contradiction with some environmental values. <continued>",0
"""...I think that others understand that while density may require sacrifice, that it's a necessary direction to go.   It's one thing if the density is resulting in more sustainable livable communities, but we are not exactly evaluating these developments and this growth on both sides of the ledger--including in particular metrics for displacement. We aren't requiring that enough social good be done. And when we try to incentivize social good instead of require it, it is comes in measures far too inadequate to do much to solve the problems we're facing. Many people in the grassroots understands that density is a radically transformational force in neighborhoods--and one that is controversial in both legitimate ways and in NIMBYist ways. I don't think the issue is as black and white as the city thinks it is and that's why environmentalists haven't been galvanized by Commissioner Novick's comments. <continued>",0
"No, he wants to increase the health of our children's teeth.",0
"Beyond that, the Comp Plan is a massive and complex document with interconnected issues and policies that many folks have trouble fully understanding what it all means and how it might affect them.

It's not the kind of process that makes it easy to organize around policies, rouse the public, and find a way to speak in a unified voice--especially in a way that elevates the voices of those most vulnerable to displacement, climate change, and other major challenges like lack of adequate transportation access. 350PDX has promoted the Comp Plan hearings and has sent people there to speak, though at a certain point it becomes hard to distinguish anyone from such a large crowd with differing interests. <continued>",0

Less profit, less drivers, less ride for folks with disabilities. But the real issue is that if you offer a business it should be for everyone.   Hence why ALL stores have to offer ramp entrances for the disabled.   Uber and Lyft are skirting that and it is at the detriment to the civil liberties of those with disabilities.

"""What causes gentrification is rich people moving here. ""  Nope. It's the uncontrolled housing market that causes gentrification. As neighborhoods become more desirable, the market allows rich people to compete amongst each other and drive prices up. They are also able to privately capture the value that is added with things like infrastructure improvements, even though those things are publicly funded. But it's possible to control this with things like Community Land Trusts. Rich people are only able to drive up prices because our uncontrolled, private market, that treats housing as just another commodity rather than a human right, allows it.   Sustainable living for the rich, while everybody else gets pushed to the suburbs, is not Climate Justice.

"Yes, public transportation services Like Uber and Lift, now subject to the City's regulatory code, should be held to the same standards that every other public transportation provider is held to.    Taxis have an unfunded mandate from the City requiring them to have wheelchair accessible vehicles in at least 10% of their fleet.  They can only charge the same rates as regular cabs.  This results in the taxi companies subsidizing them, while at the same time trying to remain competitive with a huge multi-national corporation that does not share that mandate.  While this denial of service to wheelchair-bound users is probably the most egregious of Novick's concessions to Uber (although I would argue that a close second is surely the Non-Disclosure Agreement they signed) there are many others, such as requiring smart phones and credit cards.

Insurance companies made premiums lower, per the mandate, but they raised deductibles. Hillary's DETAILED plan calls for improving Obamacare by dramatically reducing out-of-pocket costs (deductibles,  co-pays and co-insurance). Hillary was the biggest proponent of Universal Healthcare for the majority of her political life. If she thought it was realistic in today's political climate, she'd still be fighting for it. She's being realistic and trying to give practical changes and improvements, not just Bernie's pipe dreams. With Republican-led Congress and Senate, Bernie would be a lame duck President.",0

"Part 1 of 2 due to WW's cruddy comment system:  Home ownership certainly can bring wealth accumulation, but have you thought about why?  I think the answer is racism, exclusion, and inequity.  A brief history of American homeownership:  racial zoning codes, race covenants, explicitly discriminatory practices by government agencies like FHA, HOLC, explicitly discriminatory practices by realtors, covert discrimination by lenders and other players in the real estate industry, and, when all of those other defenses failed, racial violence and intimidation by regular citizens.

The fact that redlining once existed doesn't make the handful of black residents around Alberta less attached to their homes.  You are struggling with he fact that the working class folks in Portland do not want to live the New Urbanist dream.  Look at the big study Metro did to gauge housing preferences.   Finally, I note you put a lot of trust in the people who own large apartment complexes to not exploit the inherent vulnerability that comes with being a renter.  The SFH gives people autonomy.

The Secretary of State decides what is left in and left out. The bond was pitched to the public with the preserve and there are many statements by the zoo and Metro that promised the preserve to the public. The resolution  called for capital expenses of $12 million to be set aside for a possible offsite preserve. The onsite exhibit was budgeted at $19 million, now skyrocketed to $59 milllion. The voters did not approve $59 million for an onsite exhibit and after a disastrous 2009 audit in which Metro was criticized for mismanaging bond monies, Metro came up with this grossly inflated figure and a ""master plan"" that was created after the vote.",0

Sanders will NEVER be the Democratic nominee due to how the DNC will never allow it to happen.  It's not just that he's a self-declared Democratic Socialist (which is political poison in mainstream America where you have to have some appeal)... it's that he's never accomplished anything he talks about.

Don'tcha think?  I think that's especially the case looking ahead to inclusionary zoning.  IZ creates nothing without new development.  How effective will it be in PDX if affordable housing activists don't contest the memes that development is bad and single family homes are sacred?",0

For eight years, Carl Wolfson created, produced, and hosted a daily 2-hour news & features program focusing on Oregon politics & culture. (So, he definitely deserves a break, but it's real loss to maintaining an enlightened citizenry, especially against the evil forces of media consolidation and Lars Larson.) CITM had weekly interviews with my Congressman Peter DeFazio, Oregon's Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian, and Oregon journalists from ""Street Roots,"" ""The Skanner,"" ""Portland Mercury,"" and ""Willamette Week."" Then, there were timely interviews with Penny Okamoto of Ceasefire Oregon and Michele Stranger Hunter of NARAL Oregon.

My experience is that they know who they want to give the money to and they do with little to no fair access, they rarely articulate measurable outcomes, rarely monitor contracts t be sure taxpayers money is well spent, and almost never introduce consequences when contractors fail to perform. I often hear from people/businesses who would like to contract with the city or county who feel completely shut out of the process.",0

Only in states that have passed this law and you had better be really sure what the law actually says and what requirements within state law and the common law of the United States and the Constitution before shooting law enforcement.  Being a 'sovereign citizen' that makes up your own laws and constitution is not a defense for killing anyone.  It's not a defense if your life is in jeopardy read the entire legal law.  Anyone taking this at face value based on what you've said will have to present more in court than they thought  their life was in danger. Let's get real and not fabricate information that misleads people.,0

I am able to wear these most days without a backup, and I am not weirdly damp down there.  Tampons and pads give me infections, and the cup doesn't work for my weirdly shaped cervix.  This has been a LIFE SAVER for me because I ALWAYS LEAKED from tampons and pads and now I don't. This means being able to leave the house during my period! This was an issue before due to the leaking. My sister has the same deal. So this is great for some women. If you have a heavy period and a leaking problem, I highly recommend these!",0

Now I hear some uninformed self-appointed militiaman decided to build a road through one of those sites.  I guess they can bulldoze spawning beds and nesting grounds too because they  are real men and not accountable to anyone.  I suspect that what these intruders  really care about is a land grab and cheap grazing rights for their cattle back in their home states.

They've worked out creative solutions with government agencies and environmental groups to continue using the property while protecting streambanks and wildlife.

What San Francisco has in spades is an anti-development zoning code and general mentality, which prevents new housing (including affordable housing) from being built.  Inclusionary zoning combined with easing zoning restrictions (e.g., parking requirements) for certain types of residential construction could go a long way towards increasing affordable housing *and* creating the density/walkability that promotes sustainable living practices, and is the best place to start at this point in Portland's transformation.

""Was the government not created to remain the same as it was made?""   Er, no? I suspect I'm missing some context here, but the government has evolved over time and (I think) largely by design. The last amendment to the US constitution was ratified in 1992. Legislative bodies revise laws all the time.  Our nation's founders didn't foresee wiretapping and little Sally having a Bouncing Betty for show-and-tell and so forth, so the government adapts to handle things.

"Dear Willamette Weak, I am writing in regards to your recent article concerning the Northwest Academy. As a student, I would like to point out numerous factual errors in your article. First of all, I respect every students’ and parents’ right to disagree with the decision that was made. However, I would like to point that 1) the student in question, with the hit list, was seen by a professional who deals with troubled adolescents. They stated to the school that he did not pose any threat to himself or other students. The student also maintains that the list was a joke, and that the individuals on it were students from a previous school. As admittedly inappropriate as it was, it is irresponsible to imply the school ignored a threat to any student’s safety. 2) The implication that because this is a 20K tuition school it should not provide students with a second chance or hold them under more social scrutiny than any other institution is absurd.",0
"(Part Two) It is expensive because it provides a higher academic education in an arts based environment that is not offered elsewhere, not because we have an inherently better-than-public-school student body. Teenagers are teenagers, and as we do pride ourselves on having students with exceptional and advanced maturity, our job as a school is to encourage that, and TEACH them to have that, not mandate every student come in with it. Third of all, and most importantly, the insinuation that Mrs. Folberg’s retirement has anything to with issue is reckless, and I question your journalistic integrity by publishing that article that led the public to such blatantly incorrect ideas. Mary is an amazing head of school; we all love her. But, she has been thinking of retiring for a while, and only recently announced it.",0

While in no way do I wish official intervention had led to any loss of life, I most assuredly have far more concern for their being held accountable than I do for the details of their arrest.

Maria opted to go with marijuana when the olcc created huge obstacles for her to succeed in keeping the doors open. She has offered complimentary times where the alcohol has been free to still serve the community in needs of a ""nightclub atmosphere."" And the olcc is still fighting her.

What makes them think they know more about his situation than the administration and teachers who see him every day?  And also, who writes your headlines?

What’s the answer? City commissioners, state representatives and business alliances should meet with current and past venue owners in their districts to hear about their experiences with the OLCC. What’s learned should be shared publicly. Using the findings, the groups should work together to come up with a code of conduct for the OLCC and solutions that work for both safety and business.

Wouldn't you want to retire eventually, after 50 years? 2. The fact that you added the Northwest Academy's price tag in the first sentence creates a biased view towards the school. The fact that NWA costs 20k has absolutely nothing to do with the matter, and reduces the credibility of your ""article"" even lower. 3.

I agree every parent has a right to know the rational behind the decision, but not much more. You sent your child there, if you don't trust the admin to do the right thing, then pull them out.

The writer could have looked at OLCC, whether or not their enforcement actions are fair or just. He didn't.  Having said that, Toth's not doing herself any favors.  From the article: ""In one of these incidents, in September, Toth told OLCC officers that bartenders had been paid in ""donations.""""

I dont think at this point america will believe words...we want the videos...should be lots of them as all OSP vehicles have dash cams and all OSP officers have body cams.  anyone remember when native Americans held alcatraz...a federal facility for over a year and a half and the only death was accidental...how the feds just waited them out and went in when there was only 6 left and took them off alcatraz with no violence? Rest of the world does...why the rush to kill people these days.   Oh yea...that native american take over of alcatraz got a lot done for them too. it did some good.,0

To use a movie review as an excuse to dredge up what amounts to a liberal conceit, with no basis in reality, is particularly offensive.   Since the 'reviewer' raised the issue, it's worth mentioning: while systemic ""White-racism"" went extinct decades ago, this nation is afflicted with an epidemic of Black-on-White, and Black-on-Asian violence, which goes carefully unreported by the mainstream media.

If you do not trust the school to make decisions with the welfare and success of all its students in mind, maybe it's not the right place for your student.    As for the ""8 missed classes"" policy, it sounds like that's based on absenteeism rather than a suspension.  But I think if my child had emotional or academic struggles, I'd be overjoyed to have his case looked at independently of policy.  All situations are different, and no one size fits all.  I imagine if your child were going through something similar, God forbid, the school would certainly look at ways to keep him or her on track while keeping everyone safe.",0

If he is not a threat, then how far should the school go in sharing his personal information with others?  Of course, if parents have reason not to trust that the school has their students' safety in mind, then I totally understand withdrawing from the school.

There is zero concern for the side of the ninth-grader, his treatment, or his family, which represents a significant part of this story. The level of one-sidedness is quite off-putting.

"A brief history to provide some perspective: McCormick Pier was the first substantial project leading to the conversion of the industrial area north of Burnside, resulting in the creation of what is now called The Pearl District. It is the root of The Pearl’s trunk. In 1979, the Bill Naito Co. acquired the property from Union Pacific. Bill Naito was widely recognized for taking on ventures that were at least as beneficial to the community as they were potentially moneymaking. In 1981 he built the 300-unit McCormick Pier Apartments along the waterfront, replacing a derelict warehouse district and providing needed middle-income housing in an area where other developers had concluded it could not succeed. The company sold the property in 2002 to a developer who successfully converted the apartments into condominiums.  Naito Parkway is named for a responsible developer who had a great influence on Portland’s growth into a unique and desirable city. Ref: bit.ly/23xnfC9 Ref: bit.ly/23xnD3L",0

Cannabis is an entheogen and a vitamin and food.  The OLCC has literally no jurisdiction to mandate that a simple plant can't be consumed along side alcohol.  Assuming adults don't operate a motor vehicle while intoxicated, they harm nothing by enjoying any range of substances.    Lets all remember when religious institutions gained certificates that allowed them to use alcoholic wine for sacrament during prohibition.  Lets all remember that entheogens were/are the original sacrament.    Moralism is a slippery slope and dictating what adults should and shouldn't do with their bodies within private dwellings is not American.  #emancipatenature",0

The issue comes down to the fact that a student was out for a month- some parents know why, others don't- but the parents of certain kids sought answers that were not forthcoming. Unfortunately it took whoever DID go to the media for the school to respond to parent and student concerns. They are trying to now and the kids are all moving forward together.

"I owned a one bedroom condo at McCormick Pier for about 4.5 years (living in it for 3 of the years).  I think part of the deal and possibly appeal was the green way backing the complex.

That being said I was not some rich person trying to shut off access to a public lake.  Comparing this to the Lake Oswego situation is almost a non sequitur.  I personally found needles in the very private raised area of the Condo Complex.  I think that would be alarming for anyone to find in their un-fenced back yard (where kids, dogs or you in sandals could be walking).   I don't necessarily agree with this situation (locking the gates) but the Condo owners pay a lot of money to maintain a green-way and pier structure so  perhaps a little less vitriol would be in order.

Multiple acts have been passed since 1890, most importantly the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934, that regulate grazing on public lands and requires ranchers to pay a fee for those rights.

Since you don't seem to fully read what you are looking at, I will simplify it. The RX is Central RESIDENTIAL. The ""d"" and ""g"" are overlays zones. The ""g"" is greenway and that gives the public the right to access the pathway as a park with many restrictions, like time of day, type of use and  type of vehicle (no skateboards, rollerblades, motorized vehicles). It is the responsibility of the condo property owners to maintain the path and they do, that is why the property is clean and tidy, while just the other side of the fence is one of the most trash filled and dangerous areas in the city. The city maintains that area. It is private property and the HOA can shut it down for purposes of repair, etc.",0

That means that the public can use it only during designated times of day, only for certain purposes, and only the path itself is open to the public. There are certain circumstances that allow the HOA to close the path, for instance it is allowed for maintenance and/or repair.  Please, let's move on to solutions to the real problems here. In the time it took you to post the same comment repeatedly, you could have done proper research. The HOA closed the path because that area has gotten way out of control, and a sense of lawlessness has taken over.

We have been creative partners on many projects. He has always brought boundless energy, creative intuition and leadership to every effort. I have watched him facilitate dialogue among groups that are often left out of meaningful public discussion in an effort to create solutions that address the concerns of all involved.  I watched him go through a very painful divorce, and then develop a meaningful relationship with his son in the aftermath.

Also the affordable health care act made birth control free including IUDs for all women regardless of poverty so the CDC is already giving it out for free.

As the pollster Mr. Horvick implies, this story is deeply unfair to Mr. Emmons, his ex-wife and especially his son, a minor at the time.

"What is uniquely and exclusively possible in and through Christ is the negation of historical expiation in the very instant of its promise. The economy of guilt/debt and retribution that Nietzsche correctly identifies as the root of Christian hate deprives fallen humanity of salvation by continually postponing its arrival. For those ""uniquely ready"" to receive the gospel—that is, those living towards death who find in the ecstasy of worldly pleasure an annihilative corollary—the Christian faith, with indiscriminate cruelty, opens the present as a wound that it will always prevent from healing. As a result of this wound, we can never look back, only forward, to the null point of impossibility. You, my friend, miss what is significant here: the eschatology of Judgment Day, far more than atheism, is a nihilistic refusal of messianic time. Where the latter might at least emancipate us to find our own salvation in history, the former lays history (and thus Portland) to waste.",0
"Thanks dude. And I totally get that the default is the idea you will carry a pregnancy to term so it's hard to know that it's a joke.

I am saddened that the WW would publish a biased and unflattering article that actually says nothing about Stuart's character. Stuart has always been a caring and devoted father who has a close relationship with his son. To say someone once had a heated argument with their teenage son is not news. To lay innuendo on an allegation of a door closing, that never rose to a charge by police, let alone a judgment by a judge or jury of his peers, is disingenuous. Parenting we know is a tough job. Stuart and his former wife have produced an exemplary young man. Stuart has been a tireless advocate for Portland Public Schools, and his son attended a Portland Public High School. Stuart is a tireless advocate for affordable housing and taking the homeless off Portland streets. He's committed to making a Portland a better place for all of its citizens.",0

I'd predict any study of ""drop outs"" would indicate that the ""dropping out"" was preceded by a period, often a very long period, of such absenteeism.  The education committee's directing the Department of Education to ""come up with a plan"" to reduce chronic absenteeism is, in my opinion,  many, many days too late, and likely, many, many dollars too short.    Chronic absenteeism is not a ""problem"".  It's a manifestation of the many issues and problems those ""absent"" students face.  Personal substance abuse? Parental substance abuse? Physical, sexual or mental abuse at home? Economic issues at home?  ...in fact, all of those issues which impair stability and lead to dysfunction.  We're not talking about a ""school"" problem, we're talking about serious ""life"" and ""family"" problems which are being manifested in absenteeism.",0

Investigative research seems to be the exception at this period of history with sound bites and 140 character comments trumping meaningful exchanges in many platforms. It would be optimal for commenters to be able to read items deleted stored in a separate area - the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. Will censorship of innovative or uncomfy info result from this mandatory civility model?   It will be edifying to see if substantial exchanges matriculate. This format limits characters - it is unusual for comments to be extensive, but for the historian/ scholarly participant, limiting characters may not be optimal. It no longer is a forum for substantial citizen journalistic discussion, only permitting comments on mainstream journalism, the writers oft rated by # of clicks by some rags.

Joe Montana, Tom Brady, Magic Johnson ... an honor roll of sports stars did the Disney World thing, as recently as in last year's Super Bowl, when Julian Edelman and Malcolm Butler both did it.   I'm not shocked or horrified. As you point out, we're used to him selling us already. But what interests me with this is that it's going to bite him back. These days we are all more skeptical, and while the Disney World comments were taken without a lot of criticism, the beer plug sparked a fury in social media.

And, don't forget, for 97% of all commuters, the auto seems to be a ""good option.""  Furthermore, why make-up a problem, to justify another wasteful transit project that very few will use.  Jarrett Walker also concluded the West Eugene EmX is ""dramatically inferior"" to other transit options.  So, before we get philosophical and speculate imaginary problems, maybe we need much better transit planning.  Poor planning cannot be remedied by passing SH 1521, and throwing away millions.",0

"Okay- I rescind the slacker term in your case, but I question ""smug"" about, for instance, Christopher Hitchens.  We do know that religions have caused a boatload of problems, and that people have been censored and threatened for pointing out that  there is a centuries-old history of religious wars.  BTW- ""smug"" is a highly subjective & broad brush take on all these authors.  You don't engage their ideas, you just say you don't like their personalities.  I still don't see this is a constructive article.    What atheist/agnostic artists and writers do you like? Are we all awful?",0
"Well, this wasn't meant to be a dissertation. It's an entertainment piece, so I was mostly trying to be funny—whether I was successful in that regard is up to the reader. And of all these guys, I have a certain fondness for Hitchens, as I make clear, but I had to make fun of him for that whole ""women aren't funny"" thing. And while I can't say I have any ""favorite"" atheist artists or writers—I don't really seek them out, to be honest—I certainly don't think all atheists are ""awful"" (some of my best friends are atheists; some of them may even be gay and/or black!).

"More poorly planned transit projects will not solve poverty; especially if LTD taxes the same peoples' income, as the ones you claim will help.

Maybe, just maybe, we need a better job market.  (BTW -  I run my car for much cheaper than $6,000/year.)

"I'm back! And looking forward to this new experiment with Civil Comments. Civility is a good thing, but I take note of other commenters who voice concern over the definition of civility and the trade-off between civility and free speech, as well as the Register-Guard's difficulty in balancing that trade-off, and their rights and responsibilities as a privately owned business to do so. This is not an easy thing to do and will likely invite criticism from all sides at various times. As for me, I will be happy as long as the name callers either stop or go away, while those with radically opposing positions still have the chance to voice their thoughts vigorously.  I notice there is a character limit. As a serial offender in posting long comments and being no fan of Twitter, this could be a problem. On the other hand, maybe there is no limit on the number of posts?  Anyway, I applaud the R-G's recent efforts towards more civility in the Comments and hope this new system proves helpful. 321",0

In my little burg near Albany, the city council, in its infinite wisdom, evidently tried to enact local city sales tax on pot sold with the city limits. The predicable result is that no one who has taken an elementary arithmetic class would dare open a pot store in my community.     I don't know how much of a windfall this will actually yield all these avaricious Oregon government entities but I can't imagine it being the financial panacea they've been hoping for. Someone should let them know that price matters. The black marketers will always be ready, willing and able to  offer cheaper grass because, well, the government allows them to undersell. Pretty simple.  Thus, idea of legal grass putting illegal grass out of business becomes another pie-in-the-sky idea.

"""Today the continuing poisoning of half a million American children is tolerated partly because the victims often are low-income children of color.""  I think it is outrageous for the writer to make this claim.  Lead poisoning is tolerated because by and large it is invisible and is not routinely detected.  Until a few years ago, copper pipe used to disperse water throughout our buildings was joined with lead containing solder.  Probably most houses in the country have lead in their pipes.  When water is not used often lead from the solder can dissolve and reach appreciable concentrations.    The big thing about lead is that it takes really high doses to produce obvious symptoms.  To some extent low dose exposures are not obviously connected to harm.  The whole subject is controversial.  Run your water a bit before drinking it to flush the high lead content out.",0

"One need only select the Bible verse one prefers.  As an agnostic I just try and keep score.     Although the doctrine of Transubstantiation,  according to the teaching of the Catholic Church, (as well as many Protestant denominations) the change by which the bread and the wine offered in the celebration of the sacrament of the Eucharist become, in reality, the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ clearly means that the faithful are eating meat, 'the Body of Christ'.    Jesus was not a vegetarian. The Bible records Jesus eating fish (Luke 24:42-43) and lamb (Luke 22:8-15). Jesus miraculously fed the crowds fish and bread, a strange thing for Him to do if He was a vegetarian (Matthew 14:17-21). In a vision to the apostle Peter, Jesus declared all foods to be clean, including animals (Acts 10:10-15).",0

It does bring worry to the mind, since, as Commissioner Bozievich said, at some point when the timber funds run out, Lane County is going to have to look for funding for many such projects. A strapped electorate won't vote for taxes, Lane County absolutely has to have certain funds in order to survive.   It is obvious that Lane County needs to put a lot of effort into bringing a large company into the area, one that can actually pay taxes instead of apply for relief from them. Jobs are the answer to a lot of questions, including the massive homelessness problem. To transition from a timber receipts county to a strong county that has a lot of tax revenues and jobs from employment, that will take some real magic.  Hugh Massengill, Eugene",0

The cycle of fear is one of the underlying pillars of the system that leaves the US with the highest percentage of its citizens in prison of any major country.  Instead of focusing on that one outlier example of a releasee killing someone, wouldn't it be productive to look at the other side of the story, i.e. on situations where the release allowed folks involved to prosper and return to productive involvement with society.

I think objectively we or a jury can never know the truth in cases like this, the jury will most likely be voting their prejudices and personal world views.  You know a grand jury is a rubber stamp and an indictment via them carries no special validation.  Grand juries approve what 99 +% of indictments sought?  When it goes to trial, the trial jury will hear a person charge another with crimes having no physical reality in the current world.

In my own evaluation, murder is by far the worst crime followed by other crimes that do a person significant and long-lasting physical loss like shooting someone in the leg the treatment for which ends up requiring the loss of the leg.  I tend to place mental crimes at somewhat lower levels, mental crimes meaning that physical damage or loss is not the primary factor involved.  Many feel otherwise and place mental crimes right up there with murder.  In the present instance, however, I am trying to focus on how we know a crime has actually been committed.  A bullet in a leg provides dramatic confirmation of an event.  A story with no physical evidence is quite a different matter.

On the other hand, if you look at the numbers of violations as a proportion of the number of people in each group *already on probation/parole*, blacks are only 1.2/1.4 times more likely than whites to have probation/parole violations, respectively.   Of course, this is reconciled by noting that the proportions of the black population on probation and parole are, respectively, 3.4 and 5.5 times the corresponding proportions in the white population. Whether this fact is symptomatic of systemic racism is debatable, but this article seems to suggest that the disproportionality is *because* blacks are significantly more likely to violate probation/parole than whites, which misrepresents the report.",0

"It reads like there's a bit of the urban/rural problem even in a small area, one defined as a ""rural"" area.  All of us in rural Lane County realize just how inadequate our patrol, enforcement services are......that's inadequate tettering on non-existant.  We understand the fiscal issues and the poltical issues which have left us so unprotected.  It seems many rural residents, feeling the impact of personal constraints (I think nearly all of us are), are simply unwilling to accept the additional property taxes which might provide those rural law enforcement services.  I think those who developed and proposed the Fern Ridge plan are to be complimented for their efforts.  However, I think the LCBC read the situation correctly.  As we've found over the years with sale tax in Oregon, each defeat at the polls makes the effort that much harder next time.  There may be a time and there may be a proposal which will ""fly"".  I reluctantly agree....this is not the time and not the proposal.....",0

"i_pi - To answer both of your questions :  1: No, there was no link to the data when this article was first published. ( It has since been updated )  2: The graphic does not match the original wording of the article ( The wording of the article currently lists the statistics of a jail stay resulting in parole and probation violation compared to an average of 1000 parole or probation violators ) while the graphic attached to the article is still specific to how many people are in jail in multnomah county by race compared to how many people live in multnomah county by race.  I.e.: The wording of the article has nothing to do with the graphic attached to the article.

"As a former basketball player at the high school and collegiate levels and a current coach, I can tell you this situation/conversation between players and coaches occurs on a weekly basis in high school gyms across the country. I.E a predominately African American high school team competes with a predominately Caucasian team. As it appears here, the coach's message was as it should be we are all the same.   If the allegations Ms. Wimmer has made were true, one would think that players, parents, coaches, and school administrators would be equally outraged. The other parents included in Ms. Wimmer's complaint declined to be interviewed. To me, this is a clear indication of a unhappy parental crusade to fire a coach because she feels her son was wronged in some way (PT, JV/Varisty selection, etc). Unfortunately this is now common place in the high school coaching arena and something nearly every coach has had to deal with. It just so happens in this case the coach's last name is Adelman.",0

"The Sierra Club Urban Growth Management Policy Guideline that “The local community should be actively involved in the review and design of their neighborhood” is key to the integrity of the rezoning process. That principle needs to be genuinely applied now.

Unfortunately, the City Planning department continues to maintain that the plan they wish to implement was “created by the community between 2011 and 2013” (see their website at https://www.eugene-or.gov/2675/South-Willamette-Special-Area-Zone), despite the outcry from the large number of potentially affected community members who never even heard of the plan until the past few months.

"Yes, I was intending to compare both factors. Specifically, Table 13 of the report (p. 28) lists rates of violations resulting in a jail stay as a proportion of the population of each demographic on probation/parole, whereas Table 14 (p. 30) lists rates of violations resulting in a jail stay as a proportion of the total population of each demographic.   My main beef with this article is that it seems to suggest that black adults are jailed at a disproportionately high rate because black adults violate probation/parole (resulting in jail stays) at a disproportionately high rate (i.e., data that would be found in Table 13, which fails to show such a lopsided disproportionality), but instead relates the data from Table 14, which seem irrelevant without also taking into account the proportions of each population on probation/parole in the first place.",0

Compact redevelopment should be promoted within one-half mile of high service transit nodes and corridors.” Of course, that leads one to the exact opposite conclusion that Mr. McDonald would have us believe that the Sierra Club supports because Willamette street and 29th is a high service node and corridor!",0

"Hi 20-,  just to point out a couple things.  1)  probably not necessary to ""like"" one's own comments.  2)  I completely agree that sprawl is unnecessary.  However, we do have 18 ACRES--18 ACRES--of undeveloped land in the heart of our downtown that is the elephant in the china shop; that is, no one is talking about it as a place for regular folks to live, thousands of them, literally thousands.  The ""city"" insists on holding that plum for the billion-dollar developers, which will fill their investment property w/few very expensive condos, fru-fru shops and banks, with maybe a symbolic small building--if required and given major tax breaks-- for average working class, who deserve the opportunity to live here, where we do the work for those who can pay.  Until we all--that is to say, the whole community, and not just the moneyed and ""their"" city staff--can bring this subject up, it's best to take a breather on the rezoning of all the nice little neighborhoods that we love here in Eugene.",0

"I disagree that the coach's message was ""we are all the same"". The coaches message was ""There's us and them -- why are you afraid of them? Here's some of them. Touch some of them. See, don't be afraid of them."" It's a sick, clueless, offensive mentality.   Also, you cannot tell us WHY the other parent declined to be interviewed. Sure, in wealthy communities there are lots of parents trying to manipulate the coaches. But also a black family will often try to keep their name out of the news on a complaint because their child still has to attend school and be in the social milieu where other kids may ostracize them for getting the coach in trouble.    I hope the school district does the right thing and gets rid of this coach. And uses it as an example for other coaches of how not to invoke race with our young people.",0
"I actually do like my comments, thank you very much!  Seriously, I am not anxious to see the open space, like Alton Baker Park or even Kesey Square, developed before the SW-SAZ area.  We need open public space in all areas of the city.  In addition, I don't know why you think this ""nice little neighborhood"" won't still be nice under the SW-SAZ.  It will be nicer, in fact!  Have you looked at the design standards??  Have you looked at the plans?  The SW-SAZ will be a more walkable, attractive, coherent, vibrant and environmentally-friendly neighborhood.  It will serve as a model for the other parts of the city that need to do the same.  We shouldn't be afraid of progress.  We should embrace it for all that it will offer us as a community.  We are fortunate to have talented planners leading us through this process.  It makes me feel good about how my tax dollars have been spent.",0
"So disappointing that the district trots out the phrase ""restorative justice"" at this moment. Some schools are clamoring for true restorative justice programs and the district won't fund or pulls funding. But now when a coach shows his racist ignorance, they say ""restorative justice"" as if they have this great practice ready to roll out and save the day.",0

In doing so, the ""peer raters"" (peer meaning equal in standing) rate comments without context, in hopes I think, that they will be more neutral and less ego involved.  I also believe, that aside from the benefit of civil discourse, that the sponsor of the forum (in this case the RG), will hope to see more clicks which of course means more revenue from subscriptions and also from associated ad revenue. If there is a significant loss of participation, the experiment will end. A lot of sites get clicks from those who like to post and respond to nasty comments. This nastiness makes money.

It was then upheld On November 12, 2010, in a unanimous decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston affirmed a ruling by a New Hampshire lower federal court which found that the pledge's reference to God does not violate non-pledging students' rights if student participation in the pledge is voluntary.  A United States Supreme Court appeal of this decision was denied on June 13, 2011.   You don't have to say the Pledge, but you can't prevent others from doing so.",0
"Trump has been much more evasive about his budget plans. His tax plan will drive the debt up at an even faster rate while sending the tax savings to the rich: http://fortune.com/2015/12/23/donald-trump-plan-tax-policy-center/ and this is one of the few things he has been specific about, other than getting Mexico to pay for his wall. Who will pay for eradicating ISIL? He doesn't say at all. I'm surprised all the deficit hawks aren't up in arms about Trump's willingness to cut taxes and spend even more money he doesn't have.  Meanwhile, Sanders has the guts to say that his plans will require new taxes and shows exactly where he would get the money needed. That kind of pragmatism hardly deserves the ""drunken sailor"" jibe. Do the drunken sailors you know plan ahead and lay out the pros and cons of what they are going to do?",0

Smith's team prefers to lie to the press and ignore district policies, state law & standards, federal law & standards, and civil rights rather than provide proper support or management of problem principals. It is galling how her team presumes to lecture others on policy and equity practices when it is so lousy on both.

"Biggest problem I am having with the new format is the lack of a list of replies like discus has.  Perhaps the programmers can have a brief look at how discus notifies folks about replies to their comments.  Click on the little button with the number of replies listed next to it and you go to a list of your comments and the replies.  With such a mechanism it is possible to actually have a conversation.  Without a ready link to responses, one has to search through all of one's comments to check for replies.  The inability to find replies relatively quickly (without relying on email notifications that clutter up one's email account) impedes dialog and should be pretty easy to fix if one wanted to.",0
"20, your comments cannot go unanswered.   I'll start with your handle. South Willamette St already IS a 20 minute neighborhood! It is quite functional, plenty of shopping, small houses, lots of trees. Your plan would replace it with high-rises, and row-houses. The dutiful forested neighborhood southwest of the intersection of 29th and Willamette would be destroyed. The only disagreement over this is in regards to how long it will take.  If we need more density on the urban area, there are two parcels that are crying out for redevelopment:  first, the abandoned EWEB facility, and second, all of south Glenwood.  Of course the latter is not quick and easy - replacing an existing neighborhood is far easier than building a new one.",0

"""perfect example of why those in the neighborhood alone cannot decide the fate of the"" South Willamette Area. Ouch - carpet-bag much? You should be aware that those of us who oppose this oppose it throughout the city: Coburg Road, River Road, Oakleigh Meadows, and all the other areas slated for replacement.  I should also point out that one of the primary mouthpieces behind this plan is a real estate developer who lives on 500 acres in Dexter - 4 times the area under consideration. Of course we don't know where you or the city planners behind this live: Spring Blvd? Fox Hollow? What is your 20 minute neighborhood?",0

Matthew...you seem to attack the people but you do not address the subject with any substantive comments. Superstition is not an avenue to truth. It is not an avenue to determining what is right morally. If you are going to challenge any of the individuals in the article then take a specific statement they made and demonstrate where they are empirically wrong. You disagree with them philosophically and that is fine. But committing ad hominem or nit picking small points still does not diminish their larger message.

"Well your comment is very sad indeed:  you oppose something similar to the SW-SAZ plan throughout the city.  If your way prevails, Eugene will be stuck with its zoning and development ideas from the last century, including design standards.  Other places won't have 20-minute neighborhoods too.  That is really sad.  Fortunately, there are a lot of people who SUPPORT this plan throughout the city, and many live in South Eugene in an area that would impacted.  BTW, I own a house on College Hill, only several blocks off of Willamette and a similar distance from 29th.  I would be impacted and I still believe it is a great plan.  I want the neighborhood to benefit from this excellent plan, to lead the way in offering a more densely-populated walkable neighborhood (and not be left behind), to accommodate people who don't want to live in a house but may want a condo, to become more bike and walker friendly, to look better, and to assume responsibility for housing a share of new residents.",0
"Just to be clear, you understand that when I say 18 acres, I'm talking about the EWEB property, not Alton Baker?  Mike Clark had his Mayoral announcement speech there.  The thousands of people who could live on those 18 acres would have Alton Baker and its community gardens just across the bike/foot bridge.  They would have EMX Central to take them everywhere, multiple excellent grocery stores within walking distance, the silicone shire less than a 10 minute walk away, the hospital a 10 minute walk, the campus under 15 minutes.  The river and its world-class bike path right there.   Let's work on that first, and leave the Willamette neighbors solar lines alone for the moment.",0

"From your description, it appears that by ""mental crime,"" you mean one in which the victim's primary suffering is emotional rather than physical. While you are entitled to your opinion, your view that such crimes are inherently of lower severity is illogical.   It is well documented that emotional suffering does not occur in a vacuum. Victims of sex crimes frequently suffer ongoing physical symptoms resulting from their emotional anguish. Moreover, the pain debilitation from so-called mental crimes is real. When a rape victim loses the ability to enter or sustain intimate relationships or even work productively, the person has been disabled in a way that is analogous to a physical disability in terms of the impact and hardships involved.   Finally, the ""walk it off"" attitude inherent in minimizing sexual abuse as a second-class ""mental crime"" helps to perpetuate the notion that such crimes are somehow acceptable, if only by comparison. This notion, of course, is unacceptable.",0

The Dockside has refused to sell, which would be great if they were an historic building or even a remotely attractive building. . . but its not. It's a very unattractive building that is unfortunately affecting future development in the area.

I live in Elmira, about eight miles from Veneta. Veneta now contracts with the sheriff for a total of four deputies. Since Sheriff Trapp says it requires 5.2 FTE to assure 24/7 coverage (allowing for shift overlap, vacations, training, sick leave, other time away from patrol) Veneta actually has a little less than 24 hour coverage from one deputy seven days a week. That is roughly the same standard that is available in the county. However where I live, we have  three deputies providing coverage for the entire county (as observers noted about the size of Connecticut). Under the district proposal, my service would have increased substantially; the service in Veneta would have probably decreased, since the deputy on duty would have had a larger area to cover.",0
"Burning coal is basically burning the earth. Mercury is released into the atmosphere in the process, polluting the air breathed by adults and children living downwind.

There is more of a danger from mercury in tuna than that posed by the release from a broken and carefully disposed bulb. In fact, the amount of mercury produced by burning more coal to power inefficient incandescent bulbs far outweighs any environmental impact from CFLs. Low wattage bulbs, including LEDs, reduce pollution from burning coal. Now a memory, this benefit came about after industry funded Republicans blocked legislation forcing the elimination of old technology filament bulbs, which are really just small heaters designed to also produce light.

"PDXlifer says it is ""short cited"" to save the Dockside since he foresees its condemnation within 10 years and that it is negatively affecting future development. If that's the case, why is this entire area booming? Indeed, why is it that people love old buildings and their legends? I think Portland is succeeding precisely because of artifacts like the Dockside. If Portland looked like Phoenix, as some boosters seemingly would like, I doubt its appeal would be as deep or wide. Portland succeeds precisely because it's funky and charming. Take that away, and you have another suburbanized megalopolis that could be anywhere.

"Jacqueline Pynes asks, ""Why should the state push people to vote who are not interested enough to make the effort to register to vote under the current system, which already takes minimal effort?  Here's the answer: because the role of the state in a democracy, however mediocre and dysfunctional the institutions of that democracy might be, is to promote the welfare of the general public. Voting is a public good. Automatically registering citizens to vote does no harm. The state should make it as easy as possible for citizens to participate in elections. As citizens participate more, they will see the wisdom of informing themselves on the issues. This is exactly what anti-voting rights people fear. That people actually have a problem with making it easier for citizens to vote is a measure of the backward mentalites--extreme individualism, laissez-faire racism, anti-government paranoia--that prevail here and prevent American society from moving into the 21st century.",0

What they don't realize is that if Hillary Clinton can't get women to vote for her, including young women, then the only woman that will likely be elected President in the future will be a Republican. She'll more than likely be white, will, guaranteed, be a Christian. She'll, of necessity, have to be against abortion rights, and will no doubt be an extreme fiscal conservative. In the eyes of younger Democratic-leaning women, Bernie's pure and untainted. What they don't seem to realize is Sander's political purity is a function of his former political irrelevance. Hillary Clinton has never been politically irrelevant. She's a political pugilist. This scares certain types of women. Younger women tend to be more psychologically dependent on male approval than women with more life experience. Similarly, married women tend to vote more conservatively.

"Yours is just one example of many why we simply should not have a tax based on a volatile and subjective value of one's property.  You pay more simply because you invested your money (that you already paid taxes on) in your home or land - which increased in value because of factors outside of your control.  Spend $100,000 building a boat, you pay no taxes on that.  If you spend $100,000 building a home on your land, you pay thousands of dollars in taxes, year after year.  You're better off with a 500sqft home and a 2000sqft yacht drydocked on your property.  Even though that sounds absolutely awesome, how much sense does it make?  Real estate is the only thing you get taxed on after you own it. It's the only thing you pay extra taxes on if you improve it while you own it.

This is likely because we do almost zero traffic law enforcement.   This situation is exacerbated by the fact that we give drunk drivers a near complete pass on their first conviction (pay a fine, do a class and it disappears)  and we don't take their license away until their fourth conviction. One of the Dakotas took to requiring drunk drivers to wear an alcohol-detecting anklet and putting them in jail if they drank while on probation for drunk driving. I like that solution.",0
"Actually the land was occupied by indigenous peoples, then appropriated by the British (after years of conflict between them, Spain and the US), who handed it over to the US in 1846 via the Oregon Treaty. The local indigenous peoples controlled the land until it was stolen from them and they were  restricted to the lands that make up the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge as a reservation. The indigenous peoples were finally banished from there also, with the Federal government claiming the land, which was set aside as a park in 1908. If anyone has claim other than the Feds, it would be the local indigenous population, who have made clear they don't support the terrorists. Any claims the ranchers may have are the result of deeds awarded to them for stolen land (talk about white privilege) and should be disregarded. The only folks with any clear title would be the indigenous peoples.",0

My heart goes out to Burns.  May they find renewed tolerance for friends and neighbors to live and work together to find peaceful solutions and compromises for differing agendas.  Bitterness towards each other lets the perps continue to rent space in their heads.  Very likely not one of the people of Burns would not drop everything to go and help a neighbor in need.

I suspect that objective damage is minimal and full restoration would cost substantially less than the current and ongoing investigation.  When they lock up all those people, we the taxpayers will be paying millions of dollars in taxes to keep them in jail for the decades that the feds will likely push for.",0

"Discussion of gravity waves has been ongoing for many decades.  Gravity waves are similar in concept to electromagnetic waves, i.e. radio, light, X-rays, etc.  Gravity, however, is much weaker than electromagnetic forces.  Just as electric current moving back and forth in an antenna creates radio waves, objects moving around each other in orbits emit gravitational waves.  Because gravity is so much weaker than electromagnetic forces, it takes truly massive objects to make gravitational waves we can detect.  Everybody expected gravitational waves to exist, the challenge was to make a receiver sensitive enough to detect them.  Basically no practical importance as far as human existence is concerned.  However, the detection of the gravitational waves is a brilliant feat of experimental physics.",0

"The editorial appears to suggest that the ""occupation"" was a big deal.  But in reality, there were just a dozen or a few dozen guys hanging out at a couple of small deserted buildings in the middle of nowhere.  The occupation only became a big deal because the media chose to make it a big deal filling page after page with stories about the ""armed"" occupiers.  Despite all the media hype about ""armed"" occupation, the citizens involved did not actually draw a gun on anyone.  I suspect that residents of Burns didn't even notice the occupation except for the constant pounding of the media drum.  A big deal was made of a small issue.  It was we as a society that reacted to the small issue with extreme deadly force.  I am always puzzled how we as a society can teach by example that armed and violent confrontation is the answer to problems and at the same time expect individuals to chose peaceful approaches to resolving their own perceived problems.",0

Reporting on the matter does not allow us, however, to speculate as to whether a more non-confrontational approach to handling the matter might have preserved the officer's (and the suspect's) lives.

How many truck drivers have been killed while working here in Oregon?  The danger faced by LE personnel should not be overstated relative to that faced by other persons in their everyday work.  To do so re-enforces the current LE tactics of extreme confrontation which I believe is responsible for much loss of life both to LE personnel and to citizens.",0

If method employed is observed to lead to unfortunate results, it is profitable to examine that method and determine whether changes could reduce or eliminate unfortunate results observed.

It has taken decades of training and practice in physics for me to realize how little we really know in terms of root causes.  But it is human to believe things are pretty much understood.  Go back 1000 or 2000 years and ask the contemporaries and likely they would be pretty sure that their world view was pretty much complete and in order.  Perhaps it will always be that way.",0

It is not necessary to argue that gravity waves might be useful in themselves as it is incredibly unlikely that they will given the energy scale at which they exist.  It is the knowledge and, as pointed out, the ability to detect them that has value.  Comparison to the transistor is not valid in terms of application.  By the way, the construction of two detectors was not just to validate detection as in duplicate.  Gravity waves travel at the speed of light which is fast but not instantaneous.  The signals observed at the two detectors are thus delayed copies of each other.  The time delay signifies traveling gravity waves and even helps determine the direction from which they came.",0
"Oregonians should see this purported tax on corporations as another attempt to implement  a sales tax but without any purchase exemptions. First, this is not a tax on corporate profits but on sales.

Not just Walmart but Winco, Walgreens, & Guaranty, and on down the line.  As for gas for your car, maybe there is still a small one owner station with sales under $25 million but he for sure be buying from a distributor who will be adding it to his sales.  Second, unlike an actual sales tax with provisions for resale - to prevent double taxation - the corporate sales tax could easily multiply. A grocery store often buys from local businesses, the local beverage distributors for instance. Their 2.5% increase would be added to Safeway's 2.5% increase.",0
"There is an underlying assumption in this opinion piece and that is that a corporate tax will tap new monies.  Monies that will not come from the ordinary citizens of Oregon.  This unfortunately is incorrect.  Corporations exist to make a profit.  If they cannot make a profit they go out of business.  Thus if we impose a higher corporate tax, the affected companies will immediately raise prices to maintain their profit margin or, if they cannot, they will go out of business or stop doing business in the state of Oregon.  Thus the corporate tax is simply a sneaker tax to extract money from John and Jane Q. Public citizens of Oregon.  Perhaps the corporate tax to help schools would be good.  That's a matter of opinion, but those who support higher corporate taxes should clearly understand where the money will ultimately come from.",0

It is an attempt to use the language of science to disguise a belief system and talk about it in such a way that it is pretending to be science when it is not.    In an attempt to draw parallels, ID proponents have created a framework where Science is a 'system of belief' and that lack of completeness of understanding makes the methodology invalid.  It does not work.  You cannot simultaneously claim that the methodology is not a valid one and then claim to be part of the methodology.

It amazes me that some individuals still attempt to present them as the ""real terrorists"" and the Bundy gang as ""victims.""",0
The question assumes that something originated out of nothing.  Is this a fact that we know for sure that something came out of nothing?  So now the 'proof' to refute the claims of ID rests on science to prove that which has not be established as fact?,0

It is reasonable that Arnold and Co. were motivated by profit from notoriety of whatever.  That is okay.  Our society runs on the profit motive.  More importantly a Arnold apparently entered into the negotiations and added an element different from the confrontational approach of LE.  Bringing folks looking for positive resolutions into a process is generally good.  Consider some of the very negative comments here.  Imagine a LE negotiator with a similar attitude.  Positive resolution would be very difficult.  LE likely took the hard line using the threat of massive criminal charges rather than offering any sort of olive branch.  Only massive power enables the hard line.  Does having that massive power justify the hard line?,0
"It's almost amusing that you characterize Law Enforcement's approach to the Bundy militia's armed occupation as ""confrontational.""  These folks worked extremely patiently for six week to achieve a peaceful surrender.  Negotiations with armed occupiers seldom includes offering them a ""King's X"" for the crimes they have committed. You speak of the ""hard line"".  Do you propose that seeking a peaceful surrender and having the armed occupiers face the legal consequences of their actions constitutes a ""hard line.""?",0
"Just as a personal aside, when you suggest that I am confused as to what science is, let me share that I am a PhD physicist who has been elected as a fellow of several professional physics societies, have published hundreds of peer reviewed technical research papers, and have one of the highest patent counts in the state of Oregon.  So you are saying that a scientist does not understand science.  Okay, but I have fooled my peers.  Regarding ID,  it is a hypothesis which presumes that life forming processes did not proceed randomly (which is presumed in standard evolution models) and that instead processes are driven by an ordering force or factor which falls outside current scientific models.  Some might see the ordering force as religious.  Some might see it as simply another aspect of nature that is not currently understood.  But there is more to the concept of inherent ordering factors than meets the eye.",0
"This entire situation concerns money interests.  The health of any community involves many more facets than  generated income.  Much of the development that has occurred since the 70's has been very positive for downtown Eugene as a thriving active center.  But along with this comes some negatives.  Eugene used to b e a nice large town to visit.  Now it more resembles a concrete jungle metropolis along with all of the trimmings, many that are not very nice.  The urban intimidation factor is now most definitely present.  Contrary to the development mentality is the perspective of the value of open space.  Kesey Square is open space and within an  concrete jungle open space brings a welcome breath of fresh air.  There exists a wealth of structures within the general downtown district that are in need of renovation and/or development.  Focus on these and please leave the little open space left as it is for the health and enjoyment of all the citizens and visitors of Eugene.",0

"I get it, and I am open to the idea that the other ordering forces outside current models.  I think that this is a worthy point of inquiry and one POV that should be explored.  To take the leap that the other ordering forces are intelligent in nature (or must be, as some ID proponents claim) is a very very bold leap.  If ID proponents were to change the name and the tone of the rhetoric, I know I for one would be more open accepting that the conversation they are trying to have is a valid one.   I do think that leaving it as 'not currently understood' is the right way to frame it, instead of many ID proponents who proclaim, ""not currently understood, and therefore MUST BE intelligent.""  It may be intelligent, it may not be.   It is not explored, and we need to keep exploring it, with the understanding that the outcome may result in either outcome being true.",0

"""Free, peaceful assembly, and that is exactly what happened""  Ms Flore sounds like she's kidding, but, I fear she isn't.  The armed Bundy militia seized and with weapons, occupied federal property.  They threatened to us physical force against anyone who attempted to physically remove them.  Since they had firearms, one might infer that such resistance might include use of those guns.  They broke into buildings, files, and a storage area which housed Paiute historical artifacts.  They, without permission, used government owned equipment and vehicles.  The broke several, if not many, federal laws.  Ms. Flore describes this as ""peaceful assembly.""

"Oregon is fortunate to not be like most athletic programs requiring tens of millions of tuition dollars be spent subsidizing the arms race of those programs.   However, it is worthwhile to consider that football makes a lot of money and spends a lot of money--the two are not completely intertwined. Every football program in the country could agree to spend no more than $2 million dollars a year on head coaches, and tax athletics for 10% of TV revenue and they would all be running break even and the football programs would be just fine. Likewise, the foundations that court donors could offer season tickets for donations to any part of the university rather than just athletics, or do a better job of showing potential donors how their dollars could help with other programs.   I think tax-exempt organizations also have a responsibility to show restraint rather than funneling money that could be taxes to very high personal salaries.",0

Those businesses with lots of entry level jobs will cut staffing to keep expenses in line with income. Regardless of the minimum wage level, no business stays open long without profit.  That's the system we currently live with.  The new minimum is actually too low to cut public assistance for any but single member households.  A single and parent with one child, or a childless couple will still make less than the 185% of the Federal poverty level.

"After forcing the Paiute tribes off the lands, another example of federal government abuses, FDR proclaimed the lake area as a wildlife refuge of approx..80,000 acres.

Little by little the refuge was expanded to what it is now approx..185,000 acres. During those decades ranchers were basically forced to sell the land relocate and purchase grazing rights. The whole point of my argument is that once some purchases any lands it should be there's to decide what to do with it. Selling at fair market value would be appropriate. Forced to sell at 10% value should not be acceptable. Our Constitution is continually altered to suit the government's desires, not we the people's.

"Laura,  I feel it necessary to inform you that your point of view is rather old and needs a modern re-examination.

These are entirely expected, the math supports it. Was cannot be supported, are multiple mutations required for a Selectable Advantage, this is certainly a requirement for macro evolution. Much recent work has revealed many Latent genetic and regulator instructions, in all life, that change the organism when stressed.  The changes follow a predictable pattern, when creatures are stressed in the same manner. The Evolution Revolution, by Lee Spetner, lists many specific examples of this.

"Coaches do get fired frequently (too frequently). I have little sympathy for the job security argument though. Normal folks also get fired and don't continue to be paid for the length of their contract. Wasn't Charlie Weiss being paid by Notre Dame two jobs later? Those kind of guarantees should decrease their salary, not increase!  Competitive pay is a reasonable argument. Capping pay will undoubtedly cause some of the best coaches to seek jobs in the NFL. But how many could really make that move? We are talking about 1-2 coaches a year at most. So to stop that we instead have a system where 90% of the schools transfer money directly from student tuition to athletic departments when they transfer money for subsidies. For athletic departments to take hundreds of dollars per year from 20,000 students taking loans to attend school should require extraordinary need and extraordinary benefits.",0

Since the U of O isn't attracting enough scholars to keep their 1969 reputation in research and keep losing the scholars who are generating the academic grants to other universities, I think that is what the academics and administrators who aren't going to get any of that sports money should be worrying about.

Life is littered with billions of tiny biochemical machines inside cells, that clearly require many hundreds or thousands of mutations, to appear by Darwinian means, (macro evolution). But many  have no selectable advantageous function, before they are complete. Science papers by Axe and Gauger, for example, show that single cell creatures cannot select any random mutations requiring over 6 mutational steps.  The populations, mutation rate and generation time, forbid it, mathematically. It's worse for larger animals....

Either Israel goes to one person, one vote as a single state, like the very brave South Africa, or it shrinks its soul daily with what destroys all apartheid countries. Zionism, by the very definition of Zionism, is a deliberate policy of racism so is anti-democracy. Loving democracy and peace is not anti-Israel, not in the least.

Malan warned that outside forces – including “the United Nations, Communist Russia… as well as a hostile press” – were “trying to force upon us equality, which must inevitably mean to white South Africa nothing less than national suicide.”  Malan added, “I consider the approaching election South Africa’s last chance to remain a white man’s country.”  - See more at: http://mondoweiss.net/2014/09/defending-apartheid-palestine/#sthash.s7CtdYl1.dpuf Hugh Massengill, Eugene",0

"I can't understand how defenders of Israel can condone the theft of Palestinian land; and how they can be justified on any grounds other than, well, we can take it.  Israel has continually drifted into the thrall of ultra right-wing Jews who believe that the only good Arab is a dead Arab, even to the point of murdering their own leaders (Rabin). Israel will never know peace unless and until they own up to what they did in 1967. I agree that the Palestinian leadership has been less than forthright over the years but in fact the great roadblock will forever be the West Bank and Gaza.   Moreover, as long as 20% of the Israeli population are Arabs (who are strangers in their own land) Israel will never be fully democratic nor fully Jewish. It can be one or the other but not both.   Now, Mr. Weinerman invokes the current chaos neighboring countries; chaos caused entirely by the American intervention in Iraq in 2003, as reason enough to hold on to what they took nearly 50 years ago.",0

"I've gone through the data on the LRAPA site and have found that Eugene's air regularly violates the current EPA standards for particulates.

I see this as a case of my right to swing my fist ends before it strikes your nose. These particulates cause strokes, cancer, heart attacks and brain damage. Time to stop swinging, folks.",0
"I don't understand the 6 mutations conclusion you have. Mutations occur at a low rate for sure (1 mutation in 300 genomes for bacteria). So the chance of two mutations is 1/300 x 1/300 and the chance of 6 mutations is (1/300)^6, or 1 in 79 trillion. But the number of bacteria on earth is 5,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, so 6 billion bacteria will have 6 new mutations arising at any time. Given a generation time of 20 minutes, that is searching a lot of genome space every year. This doesn't even take into account that there are 6 billion billion bacteria with 2 mutations arising at the same time, and most of these will pass those mutations on to the next generation, allowing 2 additional new mutations to arise in 6 billion of those, and then 6 bacteria to have all 6 new mutations after just 3 generations.  Most new genes arise from duplication and subfunctionalization (also work of U of O researchers), so no one wonders how a gene with 1000 amino acids could appear at once.",0

"With all due respect DougN, Justice Scalia's opinions relating to the American Arbitration Act seem to demonstrate his pro-corporate bias and radical judicial activism. For example, he basically read into the AAA, a view that the originally narrow statute (originally written to only apply to union arbitration) now trumps most statutes passed by both state and federal legislatures intending to give people their day in court.  Many knowledgable people now say his opinions on the AAA have pretty much slammed the door on employee and consumer access to the courts.  In my personal view, Justice Scalia was a radical activist judge.  Not saying that's a bad thing, but please, let's call a spade a spade.  As nice as it sounds, he was NOT a pure Constitutional originalist.  He was a conservative activist judge who acted like a ""quasi-legislator,"" at least in some cases.",0

Killing unarmed people is one of Israel’s specialties and unarmed Palestinians are their favorite targets whether they be 14 yr old unarmed girls they kill for fun or a member of Hamas.

The ""major questions"" about evolution.....Simple, it doesn't fit with the conservative Christians' literal interpretation of the Bible.  Those ""major questions"" have nothing to do with the extensive evidence supporting evolution, but are a result of the cognitive dissonance that evidence creates for the ""faithful,"" and, of course, given a choice between denying all that evidence and questioning beliefs you faithfully follow, many conservative Christians have chosen to deny evolution.

The disturbing trend of adding no legal/judicial review clauses to laws is now a commonplace tactic to obstruct protection of wolves and public support of them. Currently two riders/bills with no judicial review clauses are circulating. They attempting to delist wolves in the Western Great Lakes and Wyoming. Both riders/ bills followed a federal district court judge ruling that found agency actions arbitrary and capricious and inadequate to protect wolves. Delisting is generally prompted by the livestock or sports hunting industry. Even more unfortunate is that when delisting occurs the state legislatures immediately push for wolf hunting despite public protest and against the advice of independent scientists. There is clear evidence that national constituents do not favor wolf hunting and that they wish to see wolves protected. When the USFWS proposed a national delisting more than 1.6 million comments were received! Riders with no judicial review clauses violate democracy.,0

Of course, reality (something not known in local governance) means the spaces created will predominantly feature more space for the homeless to loiter and fill, forcing out regular citizens.  Though it's only a few hundred feet away from council chambers, I must wonder if the Mayor or Councilors ever have gone to take a look at Park Blocks---- NO one but vagrants and dope-dealers occupy it now. It's been that way for YEARS! But hey, who knows? When the new plaza appears, perhaps they'll move over there….",0

The rebel, the loner, the critic, and the lover are some others.     I liked LaVoy's soft spoken ways coupled with his hard edge.  The letter was meant as a tribute.

This is like starving to death in a grocery store. In addition to the 70 employees look at the other jobs; I  imagine this mill needs at least  25 loads of logs a day - that's at least two to three logging crews of  about 10 per crew. Five log trucks making 5 runs a day plus the employees that service the trucks add another seven and I think they are up to 100 jobs.  Now look at Josephine County's income - if the logs average $4000 per load they get 1/3 of that from the Forest Service or $1300 per load x 25 loads per day x 5 days per week x 40 weeks = $6.5Million.

"And: ""This is why originalism has no staying power except as a slogan. When Sen. Ted Cruz says that he will appoint an originalist if he wins the presidency, he means that he would appoint a justice who will vote to overturn Roe v. Wade and strike down economic regulation like Obamacare. Republican senators will block any nominee to the Supreme Court to replace Scalia who isn’t likely to vote in such a way—but neither President Obama nor a potential future liberal president would nominate such a person. The court is probably doomed to a lengthy period without a full slate of nine justices (at least through the election, possibly longer), which will be devastating to its effectiveness.""",0

Putting aside how one defines ""long tradition"" that long tradition of not nominating runs into an even longer tradition: following the Constitution.

The court's conservative decisions have been more firmly rooted in the traditional role of the court in reviewing and interpreting existing law.  Obama's use of the EPA to regulate a non-toxic material like CO2 was always a stretch and pretty clearly outside the range of activities envisioned by enabling EPA legislation.  The court did not so much block Obama's efforts as say that EPA's enabling legislation gives it no power to regulate non-toxic materials.  Liberal tilting decisions have been substantially more legislative in nature such as the same-sex marriage matter.  The constitution is fundamentally silent on the matter and the court's decision comprised entirely new law.  For the unelected court to legislate is fundamentally outside the operation of a government of the people and more closely resembles the days of royal proclamation.,0

If the clauses of the Constitution as presently written are found to be no longer relevant or to no longer serve our nation, if the ethical and moral principles that it embodies are deemed to no longer apply, then the proper course is to begin the arduous and somewhat hazardous process of amending our Constitution rather than choosing the easier but even more risky course of judicial activist re-interpretation; the latter being a slippery slope whereby the keel can be bent or broken and the ship lost.

"Street Repair Proposals Ready For Public Polling  Which of the following most closely resembles your views on how to resolve Portland’s street repair deficit problem?  A. Prioritize Street Repair In General Fund Budget.  B. A New Portland Gasoline Tax Of Ten Cents Per Gallon.    Details, Explanations, Arguments Answer A. For more than thirty years the Portland city council has redirected and misappropriated budgeted funds for street repair to their pet projects. There is every reason to believe this practice will continue.  ANY size Portland gas tax is a vote in favor of allowing political skulduggery without consequence.   ANY size Portland gas tax is a vote against an essential value of a democracy which it to hold publicly elected officials accountable for their actions in office.  1 of 5",0
"PBOT was shamed into revealing that Portland’s current FY 15/16 street repair budget of $11,400,000 is about 80% below what is necessary to maintain our Portland streets at the current 12% deficit, i.e. $55,000,000. That’s right, 80% below the status quo. Remarkable. It is a tribute to our “You don’t mess with my bureaus I won’t mess with yours” commission form of city government.   The current FY 15/16 road repair budget is $11,400,000. That is 20%, that’s right, a pitiful 20% of what is required to simply maintain Portland’s current 12% street repair deficit. That’s astonishing. That means that over the last 30 years the Portland city council has siphoned off 80% of the available and necessary street maintenance budget for their own self-indulgent, politically self-promoting pet projects. What's remarkable is that they got away with it for so long. Unbelievable. Well done city auditors, Press, City Club of Portland and other civic “watchdogs.""  2 of 5",0
"To Maintain The Status Quo Of A 12% Road Repair Deficit Over The Next Five Years FY 16/17 = $11,400,000 + $43,600,000 = $55,00,000 FY 17/18 = $11,400,000 + $43,600,000 = $55,00,000 FY 18/19 = $11,400,000 + $43,600,000 = $55,00,000 FY 19/20 = $11,400,000 + $43,600,000 = $55,00,000 FY 20/21 = $11,400,000 + $43,600,000 = $55,00,000 Total over 5 years = $275,000,000  1. The Portland city council shall adopt a five year road repair budget agreement that uses funds already available in the general fund to maintain a 12% road repair deficit.  2. No new taxes or fees shall be imposed upon the citizens or businesses of Portland to pay for the increase in the five year road repair budget.  3 of 5",0
"3. Any additional funds made available by the state or the federal government during this time period may be added to but may not be substituted for the agreed upon status quo 12% budget allocation. Regardless of how much money may be available from the state or the federal government the five year budget allocations from general fund revenues will remain in place.  4. After five years the council shall reevaluate the road repair status and proceed as it sees fit.  Budget planning, even only five years out, is a very dubious enterprise. Nevertheless, it is a time frame the public and the press can easily monitor with the help of an annual city auditor’s report. If extra funds from Salem or Washington D.C. come our way so much the better.  4 of 5",0
"Answer B. The new Portland gasoline tax proposal of ten cents per gallon raises only 14.5 million dollars per year. A new Portland gas tax of 30 cents per gallon would be required to match the amount needed just to maintain the status quo of a 12% road repair deficit.  This proposal exacerbates the current 12% road repair deficit and places Portland businesses that sell gasoline at a distinct disadvantage.    After many months of research these two competing ideas are the only two serious proposals on the public table. I encourage Media companies, groups and individuals to use this material as presented above. Attribution would be appropriate.   Richard Ellmyer North Portland  5 of 5",0

In both examples, the changes were effected via amendments; the 13th prohibited slavery and the 19th provided universal suffrage. No ""interpretation"" on the part of any court was needed. In my opinion, constitutional interpretation is a slippery slope. After all, anyone, including a judge, can interpret any constitutional clause any way he or she wants even if totally detached from logic and reality. (Perhaps we've seen this?) Rather, Judge Scalia's tenets of texturalism and originalism are what's needed; close adherence to the original meaning and intent of the Constitution. If it's clauses are no longer relevant and do not serve our nation, the proper and more difficult course is to amend the Constitution rather than take the less difficult path of interpretation.",0
"A straight forward reading of the formation of this nation leads me to believe that the founders intended the Supreme Court to be an apolitical group that would be called on in rare occasion to decide whether of not legislation passed by the political branches of the government was consistent with the Constitution.

Obviously, not the case since the Court is seen by both major parties as a means to extend the political influence/philosophy of the party in control of the Administrative Branch, the President at the time of vacancies.  Regardless of which political spectrum you align with, it should be cause for pause that 9 individuals, selected, not elected, and appointed for life wield so much power over course of the nation.",0

"Actually, each and every one of Oregon's 10 full-time football coaches knows about those same risks from personal experience. Each one played high school and college football, and probably youth football, too; each was subjected to practices and standards that would be considered much more barbaric and dangerous from his playing days when compared to what occurs now. Each is a testament to the obvious, that not everyone who plays the game ends up damaged for life.  In fact, rare is the football coach who did not play the game himself. In Oregon's case, each of these 10 individuals now earns, when incentives are factored in, more than the president of the United States.

The Haynes do not understand that there are two buildings on the Block between 7th and 8the and Oak and Pearl.

There is no direct ADA approved access between the two buildings so juries have to walked outside and back in to the security screening area. The law library is also located in the basement of the PSB.  The real concern with the Court House is safety and security. What folks don't see is the narrow (two folks can't walk side by side) hallways that are where inmates are moved to the court rooms that are also the same hallways judges and court staff have to use.

Murder is at the top and I wouldn't oppose capital punishment for premeditated murder.  Murder itself comes in various types, premeditated, unintended in a fight, etc.  Murder generally is worst and lengthy sentences are appropriate to prevent it.  Injury, especially with permanent consequence is next and warrants five year type sentences and the high cost they entail.  Simple property crimes are actually pretty inconsequential.  I'd set sentences at 6 months or so for a $915 bank robbery.  If serious physical assault requiring real medical treatment had occurred, then it would be the physical injury charge that would lead.  I tend to judge the ""crime"" by its true consequence rather than its transient emotional irritation.  $915 is just not such a big deal and simple property crimes warrant at most 10x  the loss in public cost.",0
"Over the post few years, I've worked with most of the councilors at one time or another. Mike Clark and George Brown are the two standouts for digging in and knowing the facts, as well as working for their ward's constituents.  I've disagreed with both of them on a number of issues, but they always did more than just listen; they gave serious consideration to the facts and arguments presented.  We know very little about Lucy Vinis, other than that she appears not to have any experience being an _elected_ official.  To me, it is quite clear that she was recruited by Piercy, Alan Zelenka and Claire Syrett; and the three of them will control Vinis every move as a ""proxy"" for Piercy.  Mike, on the other hand has a superb and consistent record of supporting neighborhood residents and neighborhood livability. He's also independent and won't get in bed with the City Manager and his development buddies.  I think Mike would be a darn good mayor who'd fairly represent folks across the spectrum.",0

"Well, I would say that the severity of their reactions comes from a failure of the bank to provide adequate training as to proper procedure and response.  Since human life is far more valuable than a thousand dollars, tellers should cooperate and be taught non-provoking responses.  Banks should organize procedures so that minimal cash is available.  If a teller was injured, then the injury crime should lead.  We would be better off if we organize punishment so as to escalate with negative consequence.  Give a robber 5 years for taking a little cash, there is little incentive not to injure bank personnel since punishment will not escalate much.   I am sorry, but we as a society have to realize the difference between being emotionally distressed on a temporary basis and serious physical harm.  To fail to recognize the difference in sentences means perps will have little or no motivation to refrain from real permanent physical assault including murder.",0

He could say that he will leave this appointment up to his successor."" That's the equivalent of blaming somebody being bullied for not giving the bully the lunch money.

"""This is a safety and traffic flow issue"" and has nothing to do with panhandling.  Such an ingenuous comment is an insult to one's intelligence.    Total bans on panhalding have been declared unconstitutional in cities across the nation.  However, since a large portion of donations come from drivers and passengers, some communities, now including Springfield, are seeking to ""dry up"" that donation stream and, thereby, attack streetcorner panhandling.  Asserting that those efforts, instead, address ""traffic safety and traffic flow"" problems is simply applying a very thin veneer to, hopefully, avoid the Constitutional issues faced by an open prohibition on panhandling.  Of course the public officials proposing such laws can't admit that.  Of course, citizens who support such laws can't openly admit that.  Instead, we're all supposed to act like the emperior is wearing a beautiful new outfit.  We know, of course, he ""has no clothes"" ...but it's considered ""poor taste"" to mention it.....",0

The Alphabet neighborhood could experience employed-person flight if the  crime doesn't get better.  There is quite the redistribution of wealth going on- renters are losing.  My thoughts lately: we should also look at who owns multi-family buildings and whether the fact that buildings are being ""flipped"" is raising rents.   Where is all that extra rent money going?  Who is benefiting from the current set of tax laws as those laws pertain to real estate? Follow the money.  BTW- housing supply can also include smaller, sfh homes that are well-sited.

I'm not sure the city needs something separate. If the city decides that camping isn't allowed in that particular spot it can have the people move to a place where camping is permitted, correct? Also, given that camps have to follow the policies laid out by the city and will be monitored by a camp host, I figure the campers will have to adhere to the rules or move along.   This presumes the city will enforce the codes it's establishing, not necessarily a safe assumption.",1

The housing policy of the city of Portland - Targeted, UNLIMITED Neighborhood Concentration of PUBLIC HOUSING - allows it to load any neighborhood of its choosing with up to 100% PUBLIC HOUSING clients.

Of considerably more interest would be asking all of the presidential primary candidates their views on the Bundy family incursions into criminal and domestic terrorism behavior and the FBI and Justice departments very slow response enforcing the law in Nevada and Oregon. I have asked these candidates. So far no responses. Perhaps we can all put the question to them again when the Oregon primary rolls around.,0
"Mr Obama doesn't practice what he preaches.  As a Democratic Senator back in 2006, Mr Obama filibustered the nomination of Justice Alito and voted against the nomination of Justice Roberts.  What a flaming hypocrite.   Watch for the race card to come out on this one.",0

"its not the camping, its the mounds of garbage. I don't care if people sleep in tents but the kinds of campers all along waterfront and out on the trail are the very worst offenders and clearly didn't get the pack in pack out message. that's what the city seems to be tolerating. giant shit heaps along otherwise pretty corridors. if the city is going to allow camping it better give its garbage men a raise!!!",1

"Preparations are also in order on a legislative level for Oregon. While public buildings are being assessed for risk, most private homes aren't. That's probably where most people will be if a near big one (8.0+) strikes. CA has a requirement that pre-1960 homes come with some type of earthquake assessment when they're sold. Here it's buyer beware.  As houses are sold, an earthquake risk report should be required.   The real estate industry will balk at this suggestion but it should be a priority for safety committees.  Government can publicize the risk and offer educational workshops. Tax write offs and other incentives could help with remediation. In a more socialist country there would be brigades door knocking to publicize and offer help, paid by us and for us.  It's our government, our economy and our safety that's at stake.",0
"Mike:   Perhaps not, but another saying goes, ""Whats good for the goose, is good for the gander"",  the Bundys displayed an over riding sense of entitlement, any charges the government can charge them with, within the law, I sincerely hope they use.

"I like Stefan Strek's approach. We've allowed almost every underpass on our bikeways to be taken over by intoxicated, often aggressive, panhandlers. They block the road and one must ask permission to pass. Is it any wonder that we have lost 37% of our cycling community (maybe more; the data only goes to 2014).   Vinus, Clark and maybe Cassidy appear to be calling for more of the same: housing ONLY. A true housing first includes those next steps of substance abuse treatment and job training. No wonder we've got homeless people coming from far and wide to ""visit"" Eugene. We provide free food, very little to no enforcement of illegal camping violations (that foul our river), no enforcement of our no-drinking in public laws, free needles, free laundry, free clothes and even heated spaces if the temperature drops.  It would be cheaper and more effective for the city to buy the Sheriff's Forest Work Camp and convert it into a drug treatment center. We could even sentence people to treatment.",0

"The word was enabling, not encouraging. However, stopping your car to engage a panhandler and offering him or her an amount that made you feel really good about yourself might also encourage that person to stop panhandling, at least for the day. A win-win all around, having satisfied each other's quota. There are plenty of traffic laws that merit more attention, starting with the concept of a stop sign as something other than a mere suggestion. Keeping pedestrians out of traffic areas where they don't belong -- obstructing a bike lane, for instance -- is as good an idea as keeping motorists off their phones.  Funny that you would make a hierarchical distinction between a stranded motorist and a stranded soul as to which is worthy of going the extra mile to assist. Perhaps that reveals a more honest level of compassion. Thanks for the insight.",0

"again with blaming the landlords for the homeless population.  You know PDX has one of the lowest rental housing vacancy rates in the nation?  We're not putting people on the street, we're housing them.  How exactly do you think this works?  We raise rents and then keep our units empty for fun?   We are housing residents of this city.

More apartments, in general, will ease the housing situation. Plus: I'm excited for a Green Zebra in SE (you know… eventually).",0
"I think this law should be compared to the courts prohibiting the release of the personal information of those who were involved in animal experiments at OHSU a few years back.  When prohibiting release is clearly to prevent injury or worse by those who have more passion for a 'cause' than inhibitions, it is justified.  I would oppose a blanket prohibition for police officers in fatal incidents, however.  The public does have the right to know if this is the first or the fourth time an officer has used deadly physical force.",0
"Don't blame the owners of rental housing for rental rates in your city.  If owners kept the rates low, the property would be converted to another use that does not include housing.

That is what liberals want to do.",0
"I think you used the word ""encourage"" in reference to having a conversation with a panhandler.  ""Stranded souls"" (your term) are individuals who need very serious, often very expensive and very long term assistance....residential treatment for addicts and alcoholics; an assisted living placement for the developmentally disabled; housing and counseling/psychiatric care for the mentally ill; housing, medical and counseling support for PTSD afflicted Vets; housing and support for abused spouses and abused children, likely food vouchers and housing assistance for the underemployed; job training and placement services for the unemployed. etc etc.  A ""handout"", a temporary place to camp, a temporary shelter such as the Eugene Mission are all short-term bandaids.  Those ""stranded souls"", indeed, need us all to ""go that extra mile.""  I can provide the emergency help to a stranded motorist and really make a difference.  If I give a little to a panhandler, it helps a little....and I shall do it.",0
"If the last paragraph of the article is correct, there is already a mechanism for law enforcement agencies to withhold a name if there is fear of reprisal.

"Careful reading would show who introduced the word encourage into the conversation, thus saving you the trouble of thinking someone else did it. The good news is, even if the Springfield city council approves this ordinance, you'll still be able to give as much and as often as you wish to each and every panhandler you encounter when visiting that fair city. You'll just have to get out of your car to do it, or park and hail the stranded soul to approach your car. Should that inconvenience trump your quotient for compassion, you could always just throw the money on the ground and continue on your way, confident that your handout will be scooped up and save you the possible littering fine. By the way, those of us who don't live in Springfield really don't have any business telling those who do how to conduct theirs.",0

"While I am in agreement with the need to keep the officer and his/her family safe, this is not the way to do it. When police activities of any sort, let alone a shooting where someone dies, are allowed to be kept secret from public review, we risk abuse and tyranny. While it may seem prudent right now in this particular case, eventually a law like this in the hands of those who are entrusted with police power tends to become standard procedure. Once that happens abuse of the practice is certain to follow, and should it become widespread it becomes tyranny. It is a slippery slope.  Anyone who becomes a police officer knows what they sign up for when they take the job. Since this kind of thing happens rarely, the officer's name should still be released, but the officer and family should be protected as needed by moving them somewhere secure until the threat is sufficiently reduced. Yes, it is inconvenient, but only to a few. Tyranny, however, affects everyone and is not easily undone.",0

"This is a conversation and exchange of ideas and opinions.  To my knowledge, no one is ""telling someone how to conduct their business.""  If discussing a proposal is only appropriate for those within the jurisdiction considering the action, there would be considerably less conversation.  Your sarcasm relating to my being still able to ""give"" does not address the point.  Springfield is considering actions which would discourage streetside pandhandling by removing one of, if not the, major sources of panhandling donations.  You may think that's a good idea, that's fine.  I don't think it's a good idea unless we're willing to provide those services and programs which would help the homeless and destitute find the care and assistance they need.  We have very different perspectives on this issue...That's not surprising, it's a very contentious issue.",0
"It's about time. Shockley lived the high life using OPM (other people's money) in what appears to be a Madoff-type scheme.

"You appear to be making the same assumptions of our government being prone to ""tyranny"" that the Malheur occupiers did.  These people who participated in this criminal act are widely supported by well known and documented anti-government hate groups.    These people represent a clear danger to commit further criminal acts, including intimidation and violence.   To argue that this officer should have a target painted on his back, and his family to also then be allowed to also be targeted, is an argument that is extremely irresponsible for anyone to make.   Members of law enforcement do not sign up to become targets of terrorists.  When Muslim extremists attacked that Mohammed Cartoon event in Garland, TX 9 months ago, the name of the officer that killed both of the  extremists was withheld from the public, and was  never released.  This incident at the Malheur Refuge is no different, as it also involves extremists with radical viewpoints that are heavily armed and prone to violence.",0

"It's not about anti government anything. It's about the facts and the truth. Fact check site you refer to is strictly talking about the Bundy situation.

Such as government documents detailing plans to acquire state land/public property and how to expand the Malheur Refuge from 80,000 to over 180,000 acres. The federal government is designed to protect and promote the welfare of the citizens of the united states.  My opinion is that I want the corruption to end. The taxpayers pay politicians salaries and pensions. Lobbyists and corporate donors give them additional money and side deals are made everyday.  Why do you think a simple piece of legislation contains hundreds of pages of additional ""pork projects"" or favors. People need to become critical thinkers and check various sources. Then form an opinion",0
"At any one time there is between 2,000 to 2,500 homeless in the Portland central core ( NW, SW, Inner NE, and Inner SE ), and on average there is approximately 1,500 pounds of human waste ( both solid and liquid ) that ends up in the parks and streets, and with the addition of this new Loo the city has a total of 8. In an urban environment of this size this is woefully inadequate, as this is approximately 1 Public Bathroom for every 315 homeless.",0
"We the public should know that an officer will not kill unless absolutely necessary.   By keeping the officer's name secret, we remove the obligation to take responsibility or own one's actions.  Keeping names in the public eye, we have the security of knowing that officers will be aware that they may be held accountable and thus be motivated to adopt less confrontational tactics in their work so as to avoid public exposure.  By allowing the individuals who kill for the government to remain anonymous, we empower the government to kill.  Do we really want that?  Really?",0
"It is difficult to be ""civil"" given our extreme differences. For example, with those who say we don't deserve a wage that allows us to survive. We are having a nonviolent -- so far -- civil war. Poverty kills. Enemies are not likely to be civil to each other.  That said, what bothers me a lot more than uncivility is the widespread American ignorance, even among college graduates, about public issues. In a video recently posted on Facebook someone interviewed college students, asking questions like ""Who won the Civil War?"" They didn't know. But they knew all about current pop culture. https://www.facebook.com/salon/videos/10153420067871519/?pnref=story  I used to believe that ""everyone is entitled to their opinion"".

These people trying to capture our attention and get us to stop are an unnecessary tax on our attention. And many of them reject food, they just want your money to go buy cigarettes and booze. They get their food from dumpster diving, which is where they also get their cardboard for illegible signs, which wind up littering the corners along with the rest of their waste.",0

Add in the value of government paid ObamaCare, cell phone, and SNAP (food stamps), also tax free, and you are well into a middle class standard of living. And all under false pretenses.  The way I see it, all of us who actually work for a living and choose to help others have only so much we can give. I want to make sure it is getting to people who truly need it. That is not possible to do by handing something out my car window. So my policy is to contribute to organizations who can vet those they give to, or I give to people who I have the time to personally vet or know. While there are a few panhandlers in real need, they seem to be the exception. The rule, however, is that they are scammers who I would never feel good about giving to.  The Springfield ordinance will be effective, and should not have to be a disingenuous workaround.",0
"Blaming the homeless for a reduction in biking is quite a stretch. I tried riding a bike but the traffic made it feel unsafe. The homeless had nothing to do with it.  ""A true housing first includes those next steps of substance abuse treatment and job training. "" That is part of the ""housing first"" policy, although the majority of homeless are neither addicted nor mentally ill. For those who are, it's much more effective to offer such supports after they're safely housed. Being homeless is very stressful, which encourage the use of alcohol and other drugs to deal with it. Stress is also a trigger for mental illness. There is a lot of therapy in simply being safe. Plus it's the right thing to do. No one deserves to be without shelter.  It's a myth that Eugene attracts homeless people because it offers so many benefits. In fact, the city does not. The most important benefit for someone who is homeless is shelter, and we have only a small fraction of the needed shelter.",0
"In his letter, Cook also makes the entirely correct point that even if Apple creates the backdoor the government wants, bad actors will simply begin using other encryption software that is readily available to them, some of which is made by foreign companies who our government cannot coerce into providing a back door.

We could try developing a tax or regulatory scheme to keep rental prices down, but I it’s tough to do that without making the housing shortage worse.

"I read Camosy's piece. Solidarity in conversation means getting to know your neighbor. There are bios for op-ed contributors. Why not here in the comment section too? One could have a bio on file, say a self-described paragraph or two. If you write, it's nice to know your audience. Speakers are often ahead of us here. Knowing others reveals their bias, constraints, and the ingrained resistance to an argument or opinion.   Camosy could add striving for creativity to his list of attributes and not taking criticism too personally. Both add insight to the writing process, one in how you send it out and the other in how you take it in. Learning is lifelong. Getting stuck in our opinions is deleterious to our own moral development.   The news writing and opinion process is limiting. It misses nuance, complexity, the poetic imagination and the appreciation of dialectical thinking.  It's too contained and contrived in its form. It's no wonder that being creative at it takes hard work.",0
"The government has had the power to kill for millennia.  In Oregon, the voters have specifically empowered the government to kill through the death penalty.  Our legislators, whom we keep re-electing, have written laws justifying killing by police officers under certain conditions which were met in the Finicum case.  The question here is whether those we hire, provide training and firearms to, and then send out to protect the rest of us should be protected, at least for some period of time, from being targets of the crazy people or having their family members as targets of crazy people.",0
"Every government is prone to tyranny unless those who are governed are diligently watchful over those who are given great power and are supposed to be serving them.

Would you have withheld Officer Darren Wilson's name from the violent and misinformed rioters in Ferguson? Quite frankly, he was in far more danger. The principles involved are of such importance that releasing the name is imperative.  While police officers don't specifically sign up to be put in unduly dangerous positions, they know danger is part of the job. I prefer to use readily available methods of protecting them that do not carry the ongoing risk of abuse inherent in codifying a lack of accountability of our police into law. Think how such a law would go over in black neighborhoods.",1

I look at my life and the issues I have to deal with, but it does not compare with not having a place to call home. Whether its stick built or a tent.  The city has made it impossible for campers to establish a home. There are not enough locations in Eugene to accommodate these people. The city is proud of establishing places for 20 to 30 people to stay. We have thousands living on the street. RV's move around the city from street to street while avoiding tickets or having there home towed away. One step in front of EPD. Is this right? Is this all the City of Eugene can offer the homeless? OURS is now in the process of moving to a new location. Hopefully they may be given a couple of weeks of peace and quiet. Away from the authorities.

Once the public gets a look at the other vidios they will know that officers involved shot LeVoye and he droped his hands because he didn't have enough blood pressure to keep them up.

They are clearly suffering from some kind of personality disorder or mental illness, to have the insane beliefs that they do.   And these individuals are all heavy armed.

And you want them to now be able to target this poor Oregon State Trooper and his innocent family??",0
"This is seriously problematic. Certainly there should  be a desire to protect an officer in the discharge of there duties ""IF"" creditable threats do in fact exist?  Are they real?

There is ZERO mention of any threat [s] on many of the Patriot web-sites I have read since January 2nd of this year.

"I love these editorials, title only, letting us indulge our imaginations. Maybe there will be text along in a bit. Until then, I confess to being absolutely bewildered. Mr. Trump ridiculed George W. Bush, so my guess is this editorial refers to George H. W. Bush, described as a gentle and soft spoken man. The father was a long time 1%'er, son of a tribe of rich folk. He was someone the rich could have faith in, not like that weird billionaire Trump, who seems utterly unpredictable. I think I will cut this short...and wait for the professional to actually, you know, provide some context to the title.   I, for one, do not find Donald Trump evoking nostalgia for either Bush president. He is the only one who called President W. Bush to task, for both 911 and the war crime of the second Iraq war. I actually shed a couple of tears when, late at night, I heard that Reagan had won leadership of my country, so nostalgia for me involves RfK or JfK or JlK Jr.  Hugh Massengill, Eugene",0

The notion that Bush was in some way responsible for the security lapses that led to 9/11 has been anathema to most Americans, no matter their political affiliation. It's almost unpatriotic to think: We screwed up.  The kicker is blaming Clinton for not killing Bin Laden but then denying credit to Obama for killing Bin Laden. That was the story Republicans promoted because while Obama ordered the strike, he did not personally shoot the terrorist. And Truman did not drop the A-Bomb ending the war with Japan.  I can appreciate the need to stay true to party lines, but to deny history? All are true: Clinton did not kill Bin Laden. Bush was president on 9/11. Obama made the decision to take out Bin Laden.

Somehow he managed to keep things hidden until he had defrauded those folks of 3.5 million dollars.  I'm guessing he will lose all his assets and spend some time in Club Fed.  He seriously damaged or actually ruined many of those who trusted him with their business.  They, of course, will recover little of the money they lost.

The article states that in 2005 the City of Portland began a 10 year to to end homelessness.  Eleven years later the homeless population is larger than ever.  I am curious as to what exactly the City of Portland was doing this last 11 years.  Large sums of money seem dedicated to the problem every year and obviously those dedicated funds have to come from somewhere but where is the accountability for those funds?  Additionally when you start setting up camps you have to commit to garbage services and probably portable restrooms.  Those services have to be paid for which means we the taxpayers have an additional burden on the tax dollars we spend and we are getting less services because we all know the homeless population aren't paying for any of the provided services.  Where exactly does all this stop?,0

"I actually work with these populations and can tell you that a larger percentage struggle with a disability of some sort, but more and more we are seeing people who are newly homeless or homeless for the first time.

The family shelter in east county is seeing 170+ family members a night. Last year this time, they were seeing 130 on a bad night. Two years ago, 100 was rare. Camping at least provides stability allowing for energy to be put towards other necessary tasks.   It is often overlooked how much additional work those who are homeless already do beyond the average housed individual.

Much of the best riding in this area (in the state, for that matter) happens to not be on asphalt.   Of course, there's also the little fact that the bark trails are actually smoother than most of our bike paths, so the ride is actually more comfortable off-pavement.  That said, I don't have a problem with banning bikes from those paths. It would be nice if we would enforce state law regarding pedestrians on our bike paths while we're at it.

When I'm walking my dog single file (he likes to lead) on the edge of a bike path in Alton Baker Park and a cyclist is coming at us pumping hard, head down, around an obstructed-view curve in excess of 25 mph, does Oregon law suggest that I jump to the left or to the right while jerking my dog out of harm's way?

"The argument made here by the R-G is false, that the problem is that the government has the right to search your phone under certain legal restrictions and Apple is not allowing that. Of course they do, and Apple is in no way hindering their search. They have simply been unsuccessful.   But that is not the problem. Apple has spent billions of dollars making a secure and easy to use product, something of high value and utility to virtually every one of their customers. They have done such a good job that now the government wants them to make a key so the security can be defeated. Once a key exists, the problem is one of keeping that key out of the wrong hands, which is infinitely more difficult to do than if the key does not exist and requires extreme technical knowledge and many millions of dollars in engineering efforts to produce. Nor will it only be used once; it will be used without end. And 1 billion Apple users will know that their data is less secure than before.",0
"All public spaces have some, or perhaps many, restrictions on use and acceptable activities.  Any prohibition is by definition ""judgmental and restrictive"".

If you feel drone aircraft, alcoholic beverages and smoking should be allowed in public  parks, by all means work to have such restrictions lifted.  If you feel children should be banned from public parks, by all means work to have such restrictions imposed.    BTW: Humor and derisiveness are not mutually exclusive.

Who is going to front the insurance claims when peoples' vehicles inevitably get broken into? The city (*cough* taxpayers *cough*)? Or will they just deny that it was due to the homeless camp they created and it was just a ""random act""? Where are these people going to go to the bathroom? Where are their dogs going to go to the bathroom? They already defecate all up in the stairwells, this will just make it much worse.

"So it is not so much the government that is the concern, but that the key may be compromised allowing the bad guys access to your data. And if you doubt that is a threat, then I am sure you would be willing to remove all antivirus and anti malware protection from your computer and trust that nothing bad will happen.  Additionally, Apple's security feature not only wipes the phone's data but disables the device as a deterrent to theft. If the key ever gets out (and it will), your iPhones and iPads will once again be a prime target for theives.  Apple has every right to decline their services to aid the government in diminishing the value of their product to a billion users while permanently damaging their business opportunities. We all want to catch terrorists. But there are many other ways to do that without damaging security for everyone else and harming the value of Apple's business.",0

But it’s unlikely Lindholm surveyed her; the Register-Guard would not give Lindholm such credibility if his results were based on push-polling, and a Lindholm surveyor would have identified herself as such.  So what are the odds that another entity was push-polling the same week as Lindholm’s survey? I would guess they’re low.

Humiliation as a form of leadership?  As an adult you learn day one that good leadership would never berate an individual in front of anyone let alone their friends.  Good leadership lifts people up rather than tears them down.  So one might say that we need thicker skin and when I grew up it needed to be pretty thick.  If there is a better way to lead then we should not be slaves to the past.  Berating others verbally is a form of bullying and should not be tolerated.,0

The academic standards are subject to less rigor and certainty, based on my experience as a student.  They more closely match with the rest of societies' concept of 'sucking up'.  To get a good 'grade' one is required to parrot the information nearest and dearest to the heart of the instructors involved.  I am given to understand that there is also a thing known as 'grade inflation' which is a corollary of the Lake Woebegone Principle that 'everyone is above average'.

"""Some are playing the system""  Indeed they are.  ""It needs to stop.""..no problem with that.  Those who ""play the system"" directly harm those who really ""need"" assistance.  First, they siphon-off resources which could have gone to the genuinely needy and, secondly, they delegitimate the system itself, making it less likely that people will help.  The ""Homeless Hilton"" question isn't easy.  However, surveys of Eugene's homeless population have debunked the contention that ""out of town"" homeless individuals are flooding the city.    The idea of making a community less ""attractive"" to the homeless is not new.

After five years they studied how it all worked. What they found was very discouraging: the majority of homeless they served moved into the housing and used the services, but did not give up the street life. The transitional housing became occupied permanently by formerly undomiciled people who never became self supporting; never transitioned to somewhere more stable. They went home to their new apartments when they wanted to shower and sleep, went to the free Doctor or dentist when needed, but mostly they continued to spend all of their time back on the streets.

There is several gentleman near Gateway, one who is elderly and disabled, and a vet, who rely on this to stay indoors.

"Being at Columbia University in physics in the 70's, I have to take issue with Isenberg's history.  There was little doubt in physicist's minds in the 1970's about black holes.  Without even getting into general relativity, it was clear that a suitably massive star simply could not by any known force avoid collapse to a singularity when no longer able to generate fusion power.  Also, Newton was essentially silent on gravity waves dealing rather with relatively stationary bodies.  If Isenberg had asked Newton what would happen if the sun were displaced by million miles in 10 seconds, I suspect Newton would have paused and speculated on a gravitational field distortion at large distances from the Sun that resembles gravitational waves.  Of course, we cannot ask Newton, but the point is that the analogy between the emission of electromagnetic (light) and gravitational waves is not so incredibly different.  Discarding Isenberg's history, of course detection of gravity waves is important.",0

I think the driver training and licensing standards should be re-evaluated for all motor home operators and trailer haulers.  As an aside, assuming these people had full coverage on the vehicle and trailer, if they received payment from their insurance company then that company has the right to bring any claim for property damage.

I do not hate Hillary I just prefer someone who negotiates from a starting point of ""what we want"" instead of lowering expectations therefore giving the right what they want and a little tiny bit of what we want. We have had that for almost 8 years. If she is the nominee then I will support her 100%. Then I will spend 8 years bitching about how she appeased the reichwing like Obama did.",0

"The America First movement, whose most notable member was Charles Lindbergh, clearly did not want to get into WWII.  I just discovered some other participants:  ""The AFC was established on September 4, 1940, by Yale Law School student R. Douglas Stuart, Jr. (heir to the Quaker Oats fortune), along with other students, including future President Gerald Ford, future Peace Corps director Sargent Shriver, and future U.S. Supreme Court justice Potter Stewart. Future President John F. Kennedy contributed $100, along with a note saying ""What you all are doing is vital."" At its peak, America First claimed 800,000 dues-paying members in 450 chapters, located mostly in a 300-mile radius of Chicago.""  I knew that Kennedy's father opposed Roosevelt's pre-1941 involvement in the War.  That's why he got fired as Ambassador to England.  The Greatest Generation, including Kennedy, found their way to War after Pearl Harbor, of course.",0
"A lawsuit has been filed and probably will be treated as a ""nuisance case""  wherein it is cheaper for the business to pay it off instead of going to court.  This would depend on the legal precedence of the case.  The fact still remains that this is newsworthy material which  is acceptable for print.  Had there been deaths involved in the incident we would be looking at a ""wrongful death suit"" and the reporting credence would have been further supported by a fatality.  Bottom line it is prudent as an individual who will   incur possibly injury to themselves or others to verify the limits of the equipment that belongs to them.

Placing a candidate in the oval office that can galvanize the people is an excellent start. For some reason people question Sanders' ability to get things done, but not Trump.

Years ago, Dear Abby (or was it her twin, Ann Landers?) published a letter from a woman who was distraught. No one in her family had the guts to tell her father that he needed to stop driving. At a family gathering, her father put his vehicle in drive instead of reverse and pinned his grandson between two bumpers. The child lost both legs.

It is essential to move beyond the focus on individual police officers.  When discussing our many wars, we do not blame individual soldiers for what they do unless their acts contradict orders.  In relation to wars, we more realistically ascribe responsibility to the politicians who gave the orders.  When we discuss police actions, we get focused on the individual officers and not the policies that guide them.  Those with involvement with the public safety/criminal justice system tend to get defensive and lose sight of the need to examine policy and tactics themselves independent of those who carry them out.

"The best way to raise one's wage is to invest in oneself so as to be more valuable.  Self improvement is not easy nor cheap and may require deferment of pleasure.  Nevertheless, to get up above the bottom rung wherever that is pegged requires being worth more.  The current trend of simply bumping up the minimum wage is not based on increasing the quality or ability or training of the work force which might improve productivity and thus improve overall well being.  With no improvement in productivity, raising the minimum wage can only redistribute the wealth and the redistribution will mostly affect those who are just hanging in there.  Those who make 50% above minimum wage will become poorer since goods and services will increase in price to pay for the higher minimum.",0

"I don't see the adherence to reality in progressive economists any more than I see it in conservative economists.  A good example is the reference to Alan Krueger as a founder on modern research on minimum wages who showed that ""moderate increases in the minimum don't cause major job loss."" The progressive slant is contained in two words here, i.e. moderate and major.  Past increases in the minimum have been typically in the single digits of percent or at or at best slightly above inflation so this is moderate.   The opposite of major is minor so single digit increases in the minimum produce minor job loss.  What's currently proposed for the minimum is around a 50 percent increase, i.e. a major increase.  The progressive economists want us to conclude that a major change in the minimum will also produce minor job loss.  Progressive or Conservative we get manipulation and obfuscation.",0

"Life is a bell curve.  We begin our lives needing assistance and are dependent,  and have restrictions on our actions (ie driving age, voting age, drinking age, etc.) Shouldn't we consider the right (elderly) side of life's bell curve in a similar fashion?    There are too many instances of the elderly being abused by unsavory sales people and family members for greed and profit.  The elderly have rights, but in many cases there should be new laws put in place to not only insure their rights, but also protect them and others from actions which can bring harm to both them and the public in general.  I would challenge the Register Guard to start a forum and let readers comment on stories of their relatives being taken advantage of by sales people, relatives, etc..  I think once you read those comments it would be clear that we are not being served by current laws that effect the elderly.  Abuse is rampant!!",0

He was instrumental in advocating with the city for that park to be built, helping counteract its drift towards undesirable uses. He spent an entire day last year, on his own, cleaning up graffiti there, immediately after it appeared, spending his own money for the materials needed to do that. Never tooted his own horn about that. And he did that because he knew it would take the city a long while before they'd get around to it. And he's recently been working to help improve the safety of  that stretch of Bethel Drive, to get a bike/pedestrian lane installed there.

"@outsider77 and @ScienceDuck  With respect, ‘limited impact’ and ‘not real job producers’ are characterization not consistent with the data. The Lane County Tech sector (Oregon Employment Department definition) is now home to 427 tech companies. The vast majority of these companies individually are small to mid-sized in terms of employment, but in total employ nearly 5,000 people. For reference, that total employment numer is ~25% larger than wood products, which is another important sector.  The tech sector not only has the highest average wage of any (total payroll ~$350,000,000), but was forecasted to grow faster than all other sectors: 19 percent between 2012 and 2022, compared to just 15 percent for all other industries. Tech sector growth is exceeding forecasts, Lane county has already added 500 of the 774 expected new jobs in the first three years of that ten year period. In fact, new (software) tech jobs are impactful and these companies do produce jobs.",0

"I would agree with that.  Jobs should not be the metric by which we measure the success.  In the long term, the jobs will come, but it is important not to measure jobs too early and dismiss the impacts.  The success of companies that get traction and start t show real growth does not happen for 4-6 years.   The RAIN Eugene Accelerator (which is but a program inside the larger initiative) has enabled companies to raise $ 4 times the capital invested in the program, create revenues equal to the program investment thus far, and generate matching investment funds for the programs that well exceed the funding of the program.",0
"As a recent Ohio transplant, I am excited by the strong collaborative, entrepreneurial eco-system that is taking shape. However I am constantly astonished by the under capitalization of these entrepreneurial resources at the state, foundation and corporate levels.  To provide perspective, the State of Ohio has invested over $700 million in startup and early stage companies over the last several years through a bond initiative approved by voters to spur economic development (the Ohio Third Frontier program).  The program has produced over 300 high-growth companies and over $1 billion in follow on funding. In contrast, the State of Oregon invests just a fraction of its annual budget in the state entrepreneurial eco-system (i.e.Oregon RAIN's budget is $2m for 2015-17 and split between Corvallis and Eugene). Any good entrepreneur knows that under capitalization can kill a startup. I encourage leaders to more fully examine Oregon's funding landscape to support the entrepreneurial eco-system",0

"You fail to respond to the point mentioning that those most needing relief will be the ones receiving it.    You focus on the calamitous impact of the fifty cent raise.  In Oregon only 5% of the work force in the state work for that $9.25/hour minimum wage.  Additionally, most of them work part time, mainly because keeping hours ""short"", usually less that 30 per week, allows employers to avoid paying any benefits.  So we're actually talking about, at the most, a 5% increase for 5% of the workforce.  This will hardly jeopardize Oregon's economy.  Also remember labor cost represent only a portion of a busiess's overhead.  Indeed, some businesses will use this minimum wage increase as an ""excuse"" to raise their prices, but be aware that the actual increase in the cost of doing business will, for those companies impacted at all (most will not be), likely will be  less than than one percent.",0

Taney on January 15, 1835 to be an Associate Justice. A resolution was passed by a Senate vote of 24–21 on March 3, 1835 to postpone the nomination indefinitely. Later, after the political composition of the Senate changed, Taney was confirmed as Chief Justice. Nominations are now and always have been political footballs.

"Outsider:  Here's some more info for you. It's based on the Oregon Department of Employment's publication ""Oregon's Minimum Wage Jobs: Facxts, Figures and Context"" Facts:  100,000 minimum wage jobs out of 1.9 million  about 5%               Total wages:  about 1% of total wages in the State                My conclusion: the Minimum wage increase will represent a .05% increase in the wages paid in Oregon.  The article's summary:  ""On the whole, small to moderate increases in the minimum wage do not appear to have sizeable negative effects on employment. Belman and Wolfson note, “Employment effects are too modest to have meaningful consequences for public policy in the dynamically changing U.S. labor market.” There are so many moving pieces in the economy, so many structural and cyclical changes causing constant churn, that moderate increases to the minimum wage in the past have had effects “too small to be statistically detectable in the meta-analysis.”  good article....worth reading",0

"Well, Nick, I am actually glad you are a bit defensive, because women have been on the defense for quite some time now. I'd wager centuries.   My charge of sexism is about the overt (the diminutive ""saucetress"" in comparison to the descriptors for the male counterpart in this article) and inherent sexism that comes from that diminutive. And it stands. This is sexist. Is it a ""little"" sexist or ""very"" sexist? Who cares about the degree of sexism. It. Is. Sexist.  If this review had stuck to talking about the food and hadn't minimized the female working owner of Red Sauce in deference to one of the male owners of Pizza Jerk, this wouldn't be an issue. Instead, the writer made a rhetorical decision and it was a sexist one.   And if you think ""mistress"" is ""equivalent"" to ""master"" in terms of what words actually mean, you clearly don't understand what ""diminutive"" means. Also: Ms. Magazine is not named the shortening of ""Mistress."" I promise. They are reclaiming ""Ms."" on its own terms.",0

No big so far, expected. Unfortunately, you lived in another state previously, too. So a request is put out to that state to validate you're the one and same person. The PD that has the record see's an offense but it's not listed as a misdemeanor or felony version, they need to go look it up. It's not a priority for them. This is just another scenario.  All that being said, the firearm seller then has the final call once that delay is up. Three days pass, 10 days pass; they are now in the decision seat.  Will 7 extra days help or hinder? Who knows.

"In order to understand the level of culpability of the shooters, the RG reporter should have mentioned things like the distance between the shooters and the unfortunate lady and the type of rounds being fired.  High power rifle rounds can go for miles.  If the woman was hit at a distance of a mile, it is not surprising that the shooters did not hear her cries for help.  It is surprising to me that she was hit with multiple rounds since at distance that would require very high precision shooting.  If the shooting was at short range, more serious charges may have been warranted.  Whenever I target shoot, I make certain to place the target in front of a big hill and never shoot with the barrel elevated beyond the base of the hill.

Nationwide just under 20% of Americans experience seasonal-related mood disorder symptoms (SAD). Approximately half of these are in full-blown major depressive disorder.

Now we have startups, angel investment, meetups, multiple incubators, and a startup ecosystem.   Limited impact? Jeez! It's night and day different. Back then the refrain was ""What? A software business is Eugene? There's no high tech in Eugene!"" in the tone of Tom Hanks' character doing ""there's no crying in baseball.""  The assumption was that no real startup would stay here.

The story does not actually say that the shooters heard the woman yell for help.  We also do not know how far the bullets traveled.  There is much we do not know and it is difficult to judge the seriousness of the shooters transgression without knowing more.

We simply do not know.,0

If they were within a few hundred yards and shooting toward inhabited area, they are guilty of substantially more serious negligence.",0
"The problem with the editorial and your comment is that it is myopic.  There is much more enterprise in the local economy than just software.  Even in software, there has been activity for decades with game companies and educational software employing up to hundreds back to the early nineties.  But beyond the tiny software industry tens of thousands are employed in other lines of work and new companies are starting all the time but without incubators or fan fare.  Software jockey's tend to think highly of themselves, but those of use who have started high tech manufacturing companies and such see the focus to be a bit misplaced.  The overall health of the local economy is dependent on a broad spectrum of activity far beyond software.  Software is a small and competitive industry.  Local focus should support the broader spectrum of new business including manufacturing, timber, medical, etc.",0
"The publicity is about software companies and incubators.  Your impact quote includes all tech companies including mine which employs 20.

"I would agree that you are being a little myopic.  The RAIN Eugene Accelerator has worked with companies, in addition to manufacturing, in biotech, food and beverage, and manufacturing.  The goal is to promote entrepreneurship in ALL sectors.  As for the the hundreds being employed in the games and educational industries in the nineties here,  I am well aware of it, as I was one of the people working at one of those companies.  Many of the RAIN mentors are also aware of it, as they are some of those same folks.  FertiLab, a local incubator, was started without fanfare and without outside funding by four individuals (note that 3 were biotech and one software guy).  The goal is to help lift ALL of the economy by focusing energy on ALL startups, not just ones in tech.  It is you who are trying to make it all about software, the focus of the organizations working with startups is to promote HOME GROWN companies of ALL types.",0
"I wanted to add a second comment to help educate some folks, and hopefully give some insight into the longer term strategy.  Right now, a focus on software is a way to get started.  Why?  Because it is capital efficient to start software companies.  Small inputs of labor, consuming very little resource, can have a large impact.  Because they are cheap to start, we can get a lot of 'bang for the buck'.   Other companies is high tech manufacturing, food and beverage, and biotech have greater needs.  Many of the needs are infrastructure based.   We are also working on these components, but these take longer as the capital needs for these industries is greater.  This does not mean it won't happen, it just means it will take longer to align the resources to make it happen  The 'fanfare' is about education and getting the community to realize that in order for us to fuel our economy, we need to invest in things that will allow it to grow, and ensure the resources are here to support them.",0

"This is you putting a spin on your version of the world.  The Tech Sector does include ALL people involved in tech, not just the 'downtown cartel'.

If they were close enough to hear her then they were guilty of far more serious offenses than they were convicted of.  Accident at a distance of a mile or more is more understandable than shooting toward inhabited space only a few hundred yards away which was likely visible to the shooters (given that the bullet was not stopped by intermediate objects).  If the reporter had given the distance, we would be able to conclude whether they heard her, as it is, we cannot.   We cannot read more into this article than is actually present.  After reading it, I do not know what happened beyond a woman was shot and a guy was convicted of having done it.  Why or how it happened and whether the shooters heard the woman cannot be reliably determined from the information given.  We can only hope RG reporters are more inclusive of information.",0

Too bad the reporter chose not to provide enough information to allow readers to appreciate what had happened.  From the comments here we see that readers make all sorts of conclusions without facts based on inferred but unsupported conclusions.  At 100 yards, the bullet's trajectory is mostly flat and if the bullet made it to the woman, the shooters likely were able to see her.  Shooting under such conditions is a serious offense akin to causing injury while driving drunk.

What the story and presumably supporters of the bill do not tell us is whether a completed background check allowed by a 10 day window would have stopped the sale, i.e. would the shooter have been denied if the check was completed.  I can see zero reason for a background check to take more than 3 days (given the fully computerized records).

Drivers remain 'responsible' even when the collision is due to negligence; you seem to be denying that.

The appeal demonstrates that despite clear and convincing evidence in the form of a video, police authorities cannot accept that they were wrong.  The officer drove his car into the rear end of the motorcycle when the motorcycle was at a full stop and the rider was just sitting on it.  The officer seriously kicked the rider for no apparent reason.  This is unacceptable behavior.  Moreover, the video demonstrates that Edwards undertook a high speed chase in which he placed himself and other motorists in danger.    It is always important for individuals and organizations to acknowledge mistakes.  If the officer obeyed established procedures then it is the procedures that should be changed.

Often the death can occur years after the addict has become clean.   For the infection, once established, can continue to slowly attack the heart long after the person stopped injecting drugs.  Heroin use must have devastated her body, for it to be so emaciated, and for her to have lost all of her teeth.  .",0

There was a big forested area between them, about 100 yards wide.  There is no way that the shooters could have possibly seen her.  Fields was shooting handguns with his girlfriend at the time.  I would give good odds that it was probably his girlfriend, who most likely fired the errant shots, and not Fields himself.  Very few women are skilled or experienced at shooting handguns.  The handgun would have to have been very badly aimed way too high, in order for the bullets to make it over the trees, and then come down where the victim was hit.

I would bet anything that it was probably Field's girlfriend, and not himself, that fired the errant rounds.   Shooting a handgun accurately is a very difficult skill to learn.   Very few women are proficient in shooting handguns.  I wonder if he may have even been trying to teach her how to shoot.  Still, the shooting took place on Field's property.   And I would bet that both handguns probably belonged to him too.   So he would clearly have primary responsibility for any accident taking place.",0

Note that local taxing districts, schools, municipalities, etc. generally prefer  that bond measures to increase property tax rates appear on November,  even-numbered years when more voters turn out for the popular ""people"" position elections.

Such stores, operating at 1.5 percent profit margin, would become unprofitable losing an amount equal to one percent of sales every year.  A company cannot long exist while losing money.  The company would be forced to raise prices to offset the tax with the effect of transferring the tax burden to us the citizens.

The bill is now heavily ""tarted up"" and likely to slip through the Senate as it did the House.    It an idea which, if submitted to the voters, would fail miserably...likely would be defeated 3 or 4 to one.  But legislators remember ""money is speech"" and are very careful to listen attently to those with very loud voices.

"Couple of things bother me about the shooting.  At 100 yards, it is very difficult to hit anything with a handgun.  I cannot help but wonder how the woman was hit twice.  Regarding trajectories, handguns do not have the range of rifles, but at only 100 yards the vertical drop of the bullet was likely not more than a foot or two.  This means that the bullet(s) had to traverse the forested region.  Since the handgun bullets could not penetrate anything substantial, we are led to believe that open spaces through the forest were present and that the shooters may have been able to see the woman.  Also at 100 yards, the shooters should have heard a loud cry for help.   But mostly all we can do is speculate because we are not privy to all the details.  I am confident that the DA got them for the maximum realistic charges because that's what DA's do.",0

"I'm a lifelong Democrat and, as such, am embarassed that this bill received partisan Democratic support in the House.

I've vociferously opposed it in all forms and, when the state's Democratic party leadership and legislators back such a bill,  it, sadly, makes me think I must be really ""out of step"" with Oregon's ""new"" Democratic Party.  The Democratic Party was once the Party of  the ""little guy"", the working class and the middle class Americans, and the under represented, ""underclass of America"".   This bill benefits none of them.  It's a statewide example of ""trickle down"" economics.

"Excellent piece. People don't realize that it is ultimately the consumer who is pinched by these so-called business-only taxes; they are more or less pass-thru charges that hurt businesses (impairing their ability to compete with companies not exposed to the same taxes), workers (when costs of being in business go up, companies lay off workers), and consumers who pay higher prices for the same stuff as they did before.  Enough is enough. Perhaps the hostile tax environment may be part of the reason that the economy is so services oriented in Oregon. A lot of the Fortune 500 companies have left. The problem with such a services-oriented economy is that it is not very flexible. So, when economic downturns come around every 8 years, or so, the Oregon and other services-oriented economies (e.g. Arizona) is hit harder than the national average; a lot of the money used to pay for those services is sourced from discretionary income.

My dad worked with the Sheriffs office at the time and he also spent time at the planning sessions. He was one of the first to speak out about the underhanded techniques used to annex the east side of Portland. If you think that light rail was not 'planned' on going up I-205 can you explain the large gap between the north and southbound lanes (all the way up past Salmon Creek) and the land that has been sitting vacant (but owned by C-Tran) along the corridor? The lands sitting vacant were for parking structures at the light rail stops and some of them have already been built! The only thing that has prevented the I-205 build is the attempts to help the property investors (along the planned I-5 route) to recoup their investment funds!  Greed has stopped the 205 light rail!  Enough money has been spent on Planning Review Boards and surveys to have finished that route and have been working on a new I-5 bridge!,0

This plan (which to my surprise hasn't been mentioned since) offers an innovative win-win-win: A. save scarce open, public space at minimal  cost to the city; B. adjacent commercial activity, new residents, and increased foot traffic would alleviate current ""people problems""; and C. replace two undistinguished buildings with an architecturally striking downtown centerpiece.

To defend the data presented as proof of injustice is to assume that each race equally engages in force actionable offenses. Why should I assume this?

Tyree didn't have this, but DEQ only gave them a tiny fine (smaller than the value of the fuel lost into the river).  It's time to make the fines large enough to compel compliance and add criminal charges for the executives and owners of the companies who cut corners by not having containment. Perhaps we should consider banning such people from doing business with hazardous substances if the violate such basic regulations.",0

Do you think those options that you support don't ""divide and destroy communities""?   Its no secret that the SI and English programs at Ainsworth have little in common.   At least with the SI move, you 1. Get to choose if you live in the neighborhood and 2. The entire community moves - kids, teachers, curriculum.

"Contrary to the article, the tax is not on top of the existing corporate income tax, but rather is a minimum tax that would be paid if it is greater than the tax on net income. The measure would probably result in an increase in taxes on the average company with more than $35 million in Oregon sales. Recent Department of Revenue data suggests there are fewer than 1,000 such companies in Oregon, and these companies account for a minority of sales in Oregon.   This measure would encourage smaller companies and companies with fewer transactions from production to retail sale, or at least smaller entities in between. This is not necessarily a bad thing - it counteracts a little bit of the advantage of big companies. The majority of the big companies that would pay the tax are out-of-state, so this measure would tend to keep more money within the state.  If food is too adversely affected, the legislature could change the tax for that industry.",0

You should actually take light rail before committing to it. The travel times are atrocious. You might as well be stuck in traffic. Extending the north line further would just add to that travel time. The only way light rail could actually help with commuters is to have an express from downtown Vancouver to downtown Portland.

From WWeek's prior article:  *Bailey says he rejects these components of his church. ""I worship a God of love, and I believe when two people love each other, it's a reflection of God,"" he says. ""And I believe everybody should have the right to enjoy that love and that marriage.""*  *It was the last precept, though, that pushed Bailey from the church for about a year in 2011. ...*  *He returned after numerous conversations with elders led him to believe there was room for his beliefs in the church, he says.*  *""Families can have disagreements,"" he says. ""But at the end of the day, this is family.""*  In light of this, I think saying Bailey is ""probably a bigot"" is unfair.",0

More importantly, if we take at face value his assertion that he does not support regressive church doctrines, we must conclude that Jules has no leadership ability. RandyLeonard is wrong that Jules' religious choice is just like that of Catholics. Does anyone remember that Catholics were not allowed to divorce several generations ago, and Catholic women bore enormous families? No more. American Catholics have dealt some major smackdowns to the Vatican through leadership in the church, which fiercely continues. What did Jules do?

When I look at his connections to a church I'd never attend, though, it makes me think he might also be pretty good at forming coalitions with the Other Portland, out on the east side where I grew up.

I doubt even the elders all fully agree on doctrine, but they are committed to unity and to Scripture above their own understanding.

"Thank you for clarifying. It is interesting that you have seen gay couples worshipping at Imago Dei. I'm tempting to take you at your word that gay couples are welcome to attend services, but I'm curious how far the 'agree-to-disagree' position would go. Are gay couples welcomed as full members of the community or merely patronized as potential converts to turn away from their ""lifestyle"".    I understand from Imago Dei's position papers* that the church will not marry gay and lesbian couples or allow unrepentant gay and lesbians to hold leadership positions. I can't imagine joining a religious community, but celebrating marriage outside of the community.   Presumably, Jules Bailey is in the same boat as LGBT members as he is apparently remarried after a unbiblical divorce.   *http://idccentral.com/beliefs/position-papers/",0

I wish i could say otherwise, but disagreement and discomfort are close bed-fellows. :( As we try to put ourselves under the Bible's authority, we insist on grace and love for all, but also, that all *need* grace and love. That means everyone should be challenged to move toward biblical holiness. I know i've felt tension between my choices and what i'm taught there often enough. But as someone who believes the Bible to be God's word, i want that challenge. Given how tight identity and sexuality are in our culture, would you be okay with such a hard challenge coming from the pulpit? They don't very often touch on sexuality (contrary to popular belief, sex is far from the Bible's chief concern), but however lovingly it was meant, i doubt it would be easily ignored.",0

In fact, I do think it's possible to support both the NRA and aspects of gun control -- Wayne LaPierre himself supports enhancing our ability to restrict gun sales to the mentally ill. And I do think it's possible to be pro-life and support aspects of Planned Parenthood -- Planned Parenthood does much more than perform abortions, and of course it's possible to support their non-abortion aspects while maintaining pro-life principles.   My point is that portraying these issues and organizations as black-and-white does the debate a disservice.

Ainsworth SI is under-enrolled if it loses a co-located neighborhood school.  If SI leaves Ainsworth, it is under-enrolled.  The reason for under-enrolling SI, is to clear out space for families in the Chapman and Bridlemile catchments.

I know that there is a genuine theological basis for Christians' view that gay sex is sinful. However, I question how supposed bible-believing Christians can conveniently question other biblical prohibitions (e.g. usury, women head coverings, women speaking in church, etc.) and yet draw the line at gay equality.

In other words, are non-white folks in jail for violent crimes more often than white folks? If so that would suggest a correlation between violent crimes and use of force -- people who commit violence are more likely to be targets of force in jail. Then it becomes a question of ""why are non-whites getting convicted for violent crimes disproportionately?"" which then may lead to other questions: arrest rates, propensity to commit types of crimes, etc.   So, yes: definitely clouds of smoke, but we haven't pinpointed the fire quite yet.",0

It looks like there was sufficient data to do tests for significance and control for exogenous variables, but nothing was done in this area.

Sometimes the questions are difficult to judge based on the context, but I presume the important part is whether or not the comment is civil, not whether you agree with its content or not. Incivility is almost always easy to judge as it usually involves a personal attack on another commentator. But if comments which attack the performance of our elected and appointed officials are to be rejected, commenting here will be pointless.",0

"The link provided is an analysis of U.S. Congressional Districts, which have no bearing on State of Oregon legislative districts. Additionally, it is hard to gather much from it even in regards to U.S. Congressional Districts as the analytical measures used seem to have more to do with the shape of a state than anything else, and indeed this is noted in the article. For instance, if you look at the list from the bottom up, you will notice a preponderance of regularly shaped states. As you move towards the top of the list you will notice a preponderance of irregularly shaped states. Not entirely useless, as the example of Maryland illustrates, but still, measuring gerrymandering is probably more easily done by determining the amount of effort put into it by the partisans in charge than metrics like these, but partisans will never allow that data to be collected.",0

"Nice article overall, though I think Brooks fails to emphasize the importance of raising children in a marriage as part of the moral aspect he mentions. While children are not a focus of some marriages, they are a focus of most marriages, especially during the 20 years or so it requires to raise a child. When a marriage fails or never even occurs and children are involved, it is a great moral failing of their parents with lifelong and even inter-generational consequences to them and their own offspring. More than any other factor it effects their income prospects and their likelyhood of having their own successful marriage. So while all the aspects Brooks mentions are crucial in choosing a good and lasting spouse, if children are expected to ever be a part of a family, that marital commitment must also be built around the children's needs and can be a great source of strength in maintaining marital commitment through difficult times.  Google ""importance of marriage to children.""",0

Within the bounds of the law (having more than one wife, e.g., isn't legal), people are free to worship as they will.  What they are not free to do is impose their religious beliefs on others--as in a public official who refuses, on religious grounds, to marry people who are legally entitled to be married. Jules is free to worship wherever he chooses.  That's not what this is about.  It is about the fact that the official doctrine of the church he chooses as his spiritual home is anti-woman and anti-gay (to frame it simplistically).  As voters, who are being asked to support an individual for a very important elected position, it is important that we have a complete picture of that individual.  That is what this is about, not ""Religious Freedom.""",0

And the alternatives to the history and magnitude of that religious 'grandeur' are minimal.

Even Nixon, considered a fascist at the time, was to the left of today's Democrats what with the EPA and clean air and water acts.   It's time for the GOP to go the way of the Whigs.",0

"Not everyone is ready for college directly after high school, maybe not ever.  We used to shudder at the idea of 'tracking' kids into a lower educational path; now all students are expected to go from high school to college, and many feel trapped.  Hands-on classes would give an option of classes in 'blue-collar' skills which allow them entry into a lucrative trade, making a good life for themselves and their families.  Many of those people will eventually attend college as adults to earn a degree, after they have grown a bit.    Regarding study of Algebra, it is surprising to hear any thinking adult disparage it as 'worthless'.  Anyone who solves problems in daily life or work uses algebraic principles.  Algebra is the dividing line between 'doing Math' and 'using Math tools for problem-solving'.   For young people, it requires a certain amount of mental maturity.  Some students are not there yet in high school, hence the need for more concrete-learning classes.",0

Most Grandchildren see their Grandparents once or twice a year (after all they may live thousands of miles away) and, on the flip side, most Grandparents get to spend little time with their Grandchildren.  We no longer have a functioning multi-generational lifestyle.  Kids and parents, then, when they ""leave home"", it usually Kids (young men and women) spending their time with their ""age"" peers.

If a candidate made this comment:    ""If Republicans focus on what government should be doing, which governments should be doing it, and how to do it effectively and efficiently, voters will listen and the Republican brand will become more appealing.""  I would consider them seriously.      It's a theme that I've tried to promote for about a decade now.   Any stable nation state has a strong government structure - no government is not an option.   But the US is a very large and diverse nation, and federal programs that don't acknowledge local input and control, will struggle.

"There is an excellent TED talk about what makes the best cities in the world;  Public spaces that are inviting- they need benches with wide enough seats and backs to be comfortable for more than a minute or two.  They need to have foliage, beauty,  places where one can linger and people watch, read, reflect, rest.  The city center should be public, this is key to having an inviting city, a city with heart.   The question I keep asking is how do we make it work for all people, the advantaged and the disadvantaged?  And the follow up question which digs into a much more difficult issue;  How do we help those who are struggling/disadvantaged get on their feet?  I spend a good amount of time downtown, usually at the library and occasionally taking the bus to lighten my carbon footprint.  Most of these street people are young adults. What can we do to help them?  Is there a place we can create for them to feel safe, develop their talents and help them become fulfilled and healed?",0

(I find it difficult to say, but in some cases institutional housing is the best way to offer advanced mental health care as well)     But after living in three very different parts of the country, housing needs are not same, not in price, not in needs, not in construction.

The super rich will not give up their power willingly and will use violence, CIA dirty tricks, the FBI and whatever other means necessary to prevent the impoverished and exploited masses from taking back the power that rightfully belongs to them.  Some of these people will use legal means for the take back of power, while others will necessarily fight violence with violence. It will take both approaches to obtain results. The Malheur occupation was a situation of rich ranchers exploiting the ignorance of poorer white people to legitimate the privatization of public lands, one of the aims of the super rich. The Malheur occupation didn't succeed. Poor white people have the disadvantage of being sucked into believing their interests lie with rich whites when it doesn't.

The RG proposes an action that highlights Republican obstructionism rather than gets a new justice on the court.  I personally believe Obama should take the high road and ask senate Republicans for a list of nominees that they could support.  If the Republicans are truly obstructionist, the list will be staunchly conservative.  It may be, however, that the list will contain compromise candidates acceptable to all.

"Interesting that you reference KenPom.com, and don't discuss Pomeroy's recent study suggesting defenses have little control over whether their opponent's 3 point shot goes in.  What defenses can control is the number of 3 point attempts their opponents shoot.  In that regard, Oregon's opponents are putting up roughly a third of their FG attempts from three, and ~243 D1 schools are allowing more three point attempts (or 5 more P12 schools).   Programs like SMU, Syracuse, and Xavier are letting their opponents shoot 40% or more of their FG attempts from three (OSU is close to that group at almost 39%).  Certainly the Ducks can improve by reducing opponent 3 point attempts.  That should probably be the focus as opposed to whether or not a mediocre shooting team like Stanford happens to get hot on a Saturday in February.  Every team will have a hot shoot game eventually.  Even little Prairie View A&M, who shoots just 26.1% from deep, made 7 or 10 threes at Wisconsin in November.",0

The flip-side of that is having a big man trying to rotate back out to defend an open corner three.  There are always trade-offs. High percentage three's don't guarantee victories.

"The 2-year Tourism Board Budget is $35,000,000, or approximately $17,500,000 per year, per page 24 of their strategic plan.  These revenues are generated from the 1% statewide lodging tax.

If they increase the lodging tax by .8% for 4 years, they will increase the revenues by 80% for 4 years.    That means in year 1, they will raise $14,700,000 (80% of $18,375,000).  In year 2, the new tax will raise $15,435,000 (80% of $19,293,750).  Then $16M in year 3 and $17M in year 4. In 4 years, the new tax raises $63,358,838.  More than enough for a track event ($25M).

I disagree. The primary function of any weapon in the hands of any responsible individual is deterrence as demonstrated by the fact that the vast majority of weapons are never used to kill anyone. The fact that irresponsible and crazy individuals exist in tiny numbers and always will is not the weapon manufacturer's fault and is in fact the reason why responsible people should be allowed to purchase these weapons.,0

It had a large number of medical and dental offices (including my uncle-a dentist at that time) and a pharmacy, Baker's Pharmacy, adjoining on the street level owned by Martha Baker. It was a significant building in downtown Eugene. I remember it had a marble floor in the lobby. Super to see local investors bringing it back to life.  Close by was the old Quackenbush building-THE hardware store in Eugene with the air tubes that took your money on the ground level and sent it upstairs to someone who made change and a receipt (no credit cards then) and ""shot"" it back again to the clerk downstairs and you were on your way. Downtown was a great place then and it is heartening to see it come back. Anyone remember the Heileg Theatre at the north end of Willamette? The orig. Hutches's & wood floors.",0

When the historically marginalized, exploited and oppressed in the United States have power to make decisions about their lives and the US fulfills its obligation to be a truly democratic country who will need any more power? Why would people need to ""go"" somewhere ""after""? It is the super rich who are always hungry for more power, more control, more resources, more wealth. American history demonstrates that the privileged dominate the institutions of society for their own interests at the expense of everyone else. The masses would be content with control over their lives in the form of nationalized healthcare, access to education, an end to residential segregation, jobs that help people and the nation to adapt to climate change.

This exclusionary religious perspective (which has given us countless bloody wars for centuries)--believe what we do or you can't be saved--requires, again, that I ask:  ""What the heck is Jules doing supporting this religious perspective?""

The president should put forward any candidate he choses and it should be accepted or rejected by the Senate.         The law says that the senate must advise and consent.  I would take their unwillingness to do either as a clear message that their advice is of no value.    Conduct the hearing with the senators who are willing.

The Senate has the right to ask all the question they want of a candidate.   If they have no questions I'd be pleased to see the nomination forwarded.  If the parties were reversed I would say exactly the same thing.  Apparently the Republican senate has forgoten how to lead and functions only as a reaction to the President.

"""Prozanski has refused to extend the statute of limitations for rape to 20 years, like many other states,""  That is being very unfair to Prozanski.  He supported increasing Oregon's previous statute of limitations on rape from 6 to 12 years, doubling the time frame.  And he helped guide it through the legislature so that it past.   So effective this year, the limitation is now 12 years.  You also fail to mention that Oregon has a special provision if a DNA match is made.   If there is DNA evidence and there is a match, there is NO STATUE OF LIMITATIONS for ANY FIRST DEGREE sex crimes in Oregon.   And if it is a SECOND DEGREE sex crime, and there is a DNA match, the statue of limitations is 25 years.  And the notion that Oregon compares badly with other states is nonsense.   The statue of limitations for rape in California is 10 years.  The state of Washington is 10 years too.   So Oregon's 12 years is now LONGER than either of our neighboring states.",0

Looking at the issue some more, it looks like the Southern Baptists and Imago Dei have very similar doctrines, except that the Southern Baptists don't drink, dance or smoke.  Having said that, Imago Dei is a conservative fundy church with the usual doctrines- patriarchy, anti-gay.",0
"Well, it's March 1, 2106.  The US Supreme Court has NOT imploded due to the death of Justice Scalia.  Two decisions were released today, one civil and one criminal (affirming a mandatory minimum Ten (10) year sentence for a conviction of kiddie porn).   Both were 6-2 decisions.   And Justice Thomas, who often voted with Scalia, 'peppered' a government attorney with questions in a criminal case before the Court.  He has been silent on the bench for about a decade.  Sorry, Chicken Little.  Maybe a couple of your favorite cases will be ruled on other than how you wish, but civilization as we know it is not ending just yet.  Historically, we used to have six person Supreme Courts and the country survived it.",0
Gary:  I agree with your statements that it was with good intentions that affirmative action and Title IX was started.   If it was not based on skin colour or gender but more on the situation that a person is in than I believe it would be more acceptable.,0
"Judi:  We're very fortunate that our grandchldren are all in Eugene.  We've been able to baby sit, attend birthdays etc, attend kidsports games, take them on ""road trips"" and have them be part of our lives and we be part of theirs.  As you say, it's wonderful to have that opportunity as you do with the two who live in the area.  There's no easy answer regarding those grandkids who are so far away.  As I read your post it tells me your a great grandmother (likely not a great-grandmother yet, but I hope you have that opportunity.)  best regards,  Gary",0
"I thought Schill had previously said he was looking to cut unproductive tenured faculty in the College of Arts and Sciences? His point was these tenured faculty were not carrying adequate teaching load, which was being disproportionately carried by non-tenured track faculty. So, then, how is cutting the non-tenured faculty going to result in sufficient cost cutting, while also not hurting the instructional needs of undergraduate students, for them to finish on time and not prolong their wait time to take the classes they need to graduate? There seems to be some incongruence between what Schill said and what he has done.",0
Could someone check a rumor for me.  It's my understanding that Jerry Springer has been selected to moderate the next GOP debate.  Is this true?,0
"Can you elaborate on the differences?  Southern Baptists don't smoke/drink.  On the other hand, I am not sure that   there are big differences in the way Imago Dei and Thomas Road approach sexuality and women's roles.  It is important to delineate where Imago Dei sits in the fundie Baptist world.",0
"Wait just a moment here!!! Are you really suggesting that insults about ""big ears"" and ""wetting one's parts"" are not Presidential?  When a Presidential primary contest and the debates resemble Reality TV it's, I think, safe to say we're in trouble.  Republicans.......don't these guys embarrass you at least a little bit??",0
"You can call it reparation if you want but it is still based on race.   Your side says it wants to have a colour blind society, but your side keeps on dividing us up by race, either to give out 'reparations' or for other reasons.",0
"Sorry to pop another of your bubbles but the civil war was indeed about states' rights.   Slavery was involved as an excuse.   This is a battle that started with the Revolutionary War and is still on-going.   To further dis-illusion you, some of the 'evil rich white men' were, also,  quite instrumental in ending slavery.",1
"Bill: In 1969 I was teaching in an inner-city high school in Riverside, California.  The issue of affirmative action arose regarding ""advanced placement"" courses.  I presented the following idea which was adopted and worked.  1) We determined the percentage makeup of the student body (Black, Hispanic and non-Black/Hispanic.  We had almost a 1/3, 1/3 1/3 composition as it turned out. 2)  We determined the seats available in the classes....36 was the number used. 3)  The affected Departments chose their enrollment using those percentage figures. 4)  Minorities were ""equally"" represented based on their percentage of the school enrollment. 5) It worked out well, since there was no ""unfair"" affirmative action and no basis for claims of racial or ethnic discrimination.    As, I think,you and I agree, we need to address racial/ethnic/sexist discrimination while, at the same time, working to be fair, rather than punitive, in so doing.  best regards, Gary",0
"He wants more courses taught by tenured faculty. After letting go the non-tenured faculty, the departments need to now push those tenured faculty to teach courses previously taught by non-tenured faculty. Not teaching the courses isn't really an option since then they would lose out on the tuition dollars.",0
