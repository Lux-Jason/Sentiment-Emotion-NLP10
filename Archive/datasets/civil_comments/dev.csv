"Instead of wringing our hands and nibbling the periphery of the issue, how about we face the actual issue head on? I would support a city ordinance against loitering, and applaud city councilors who champion a real and permanent solution.  The details could be determined, but would include a limit to persons sitting, standing, lying, smoking, conversing over a certain amount of time, perhaps 10 minutes. Exceptions, of course, would be for shopping, dining, attending a licensed and approved event, etc.  It is noble to provide some services for the truly needy in our community, but that, in my estimation, is a separate issue. I do not wish for my city to provide for nor encourage idle and harassing behaviors in our city core.  Enough is enough!",0

As a current FAA employee that stands to make out like a bandit if they do privatize, this is inane! I'll just have to collect my military retirement, FAA retirement, and go to work maintaining the same equipment I maintain now. And no, there are no other people in the USA that has experience on AK's ""unique"" equipment. Once they do upgrade to new equipment, we will be like the lower 48 but until then, we're it.

Yes, it would be expensive, but to protect billions upon billions of dollars of infrastructure, population, and critical military bases in Hawaii would be a no-brainer and worth it.  Even with the other type of interceptors based in Alaska, it would be smart to have this additional layer of defense.",0
"Wow.  Who knew there were so many Russian trolls interested in the G&M?  The inconvenient truth for our Russian friends is that their story does not hold water.  In particular, the idea that Assad innocently and accidentally bombed a cache of chemical weapons held by the rebels is completely ridiculous.  If a chemical weapons facility had been hit, the resulting explosion would most likely have caused the chemical to burn up, international weapons experts say. And a nerve agent like sarin is not likely to be stored in its active form in such a facility, and its components would need to be mixed to be lethal.",0

"Walker recently attended a borough council meeting and one of the things he brings up is our state's credit rating, specifically a downgrade by Moody's. Walker says that Alaska suffered a downgrade due to the inability of the legislature to agree to his fiscal plan which basically maintains spending at current levels and the deferral of tax credits that will be over a billion dollars by this time next year. Cutting spending over increases over the last two years is clearly an attempt to pull the wool over Alaskan's eyes. In NANA's downgrade, Moody's gives us their rationale which is liquidity driven; discourage borrowing; discourage debt. The three credit agency's have down graded our credit worthiness out of concern over spending and fiscal discipline.  I think it's time that Walker quit spending and start sharing the truth with Alaskans.",0

"One only needed to read the police reports that the Register Guard posted, to easily see that these men engaged in extremely inappropriate behavior.  As best as I can remember from the RG, they freely admitted to engaging in unbecoming and offensive behavior to the police.   The fact that the behavior could not be shown to have been illegal and broken the law, is beside the point.  Tell me, would you like for your own sister or daughter to have been taken drunk into a bathroom, and treated like that?   Normal people find such behavior to be shocking and immoral.   Even if there was consent.  So I say so what if the Register Guard tried and convicted the men in the court of public opinion?   I found their articles to be very credible and convincing.   No bad journalism at all there, in my opinion.   The RG reporting certainly convinced me that these men were a discredit to the University.

But once you get into politics, she is so rabidly left and horribly nasty to anyone who doesn't agree with her that she becomes impossible to work with.  She's also terribly insecure and has been living in constant fear for years that Tulsi was going to challenge her.  Guess she doesn't have to worry about that now--Colleen will be sitting in her seat in six months.",0

The draft mags I read said Lynch needed to sit for a year. I didn't read any that suggested it might take 2 or more but it seems to be the case. As for Goff going 0-7 that argument would hold more water if i felt that the Rams were a QB away from being a good team. That team had a lot of problems. The other issue is that when Goff got his chance to play over CK the Rams never looked back. When Lynch got his chance to play they handed the job right back to Siemian. So I think the question is this:A)Do you play Lynch when he is healthy no matter what and just call it a season? B) Or do you continue with Siemian and try to make the playoffs? It depends on how the coaching staff sees the team. The Rams knew they couldn't compete with the Seahawks or Cards for the division title so going with Goff was a real option. Denver right now stands 1 game out of 1st place and have already beaten two division opponents. It might be tough to convince VJ that A is the better option. The Little Guy,0

"For most of human history the poorest 75 to 95% of humanity had exactly zero assets.  Today we're worried because only the poorest 50% of humanity have nearly zero assets?  Having virtually zero, or even negative, net worth isn't necessarily a bad thing either, almost all of us were there are one point in our lives, likely for many years.  From when I was 18 until I was 25 my net worth would rarely have edged into the low thousands and occasionally was in the negative.  It was only after I graduated and started working full-time that I started gaining more than a trivial level of assets. and paid off my liabilities.  Now I am no where close to the top 2 Canadians, or even into the top 20% of Canadians by net worth, but my net worth is easily 100 times higher than it was 15 years ago.  So is the fact that a very ""middle class"" person in their late 30's owns as much as 100 university students necessarily a bad thing?",0

"I think that we need to find a real solution to the real problem of Abortion. Abortion represents a loss of Hope by a woman that the child she is carrying will have any kind of future. I think that the continuing effort to prohibit or limit access to abortion providers doesn't solve the problem; any parent can tell you that if you make something forbidden, your kids are more likely to seek that thing out (I can vouch for this fact). A solution that appears to work better, as measured by the abortion rate, is to give that woman Hope, by providing free kindergarten, buttressing the Earned Income Tax Credit, and showing that woman that by our country's investing in innovation, there will be a job out there for her kid. Not to make this a political argument, but it is under Democratic presidents (Obama) that the abortion rate fell to its lowest level ever. Our current president and our government is failing at creating Hope, and that is sad.",0

I certainly pay more than my fair share. Which isn't the point. The point is the tax burden is too high collectively.

Therein lies my point. Feel free to send more of your money in – don't assume all of the rest of us are excited about funding inefficiencies.  Best of luck to you.,0

It is beyond amazing to me that so little of this was addressed during the Republican primaries. Their behavior leads me to believe that they actually wanted him to be elected. But the other side is this:  I do not agree with you that the facts about Trump were given sufficient play.  The way that the press treated him was very similar to the way that some adults handle children who are bullies:  they say that the bullies should stop, but speak admiringly about their exploits, so that the bullies get the message that what they are doing is actually good.  I think that the press wrote this way about Trump, without making clear that what Trump was doing was not good, that this was not just another episode in a reality show.

"In claiming to be a Democrat, Mick Reynolds may in my opinion be flying false colors by calling ""fake news"" from the New York Times.

The draft report, before public release, has to be approved by 13 federal agencies including the EPA, headed by Scott Pruitt, who denies both climate change and it human causation.

Incidentally stock market long term average is also 5-6% a year. It is not 10-20%.  2) Historically the house price to income ratio was 3.41. Now the house price to income ratio is 7.62 in Toronto, and 5.4 in Canada nationally.   It has been shown that people's mortgage payments are similar to what they were in 1980s. However, due to the interest rates having stayed persistently low, they are carrying much higher total debt, and smaller portion of interest.  That means that if rates rise, all that debt is going to become unsustainable, and the market will have to correct.  The question is what market event will cause rates to rise, and with the US Federal Reserve outlook, rate rises look to be more likely in the next year or two.",0

However, my personal view (as a practising Catholic) counts for little in this matter. My point is that having women priests will not be the answer to the problems of the Catholic Church in Ireland. The problems go far deeper than a shortage of priests. Have you read the article, or looked at the website of the ACP? The main problems seem to be a frontline priesthood which feels it has lost its place in Irish society (partly - but not entirely - the result of the abuse scandal); a local hierarchy which is mostly perceived as remote and unsupportive of the priests; and a papal nuncio who seems to be on a completely different page from most others.  How will adding some women priests to this toxic mix of clericalism solve 'most of our problems'?",0

Your notion of exiting the Pac-12 is hardly new.

The number of women who have late term abortion for fetal defects is a small minority.  In one large US study it represented 3.3% of the abortions.  The Guttmacher Institute in 2011 published a study that concluded that women have late term abortions for the same reasons woman have 1st trimester abortions.  There is no scientific difference between a living infant born at 24 weeks and a fetus in utero at 24 weeks gestation.  It is preposterous to imply otherwise.  Those who support late term abortions either have to be science deniers or people who believe that human life has no inherent value/dignity.,0

Our shopkeeper upon retiring with $750k (at the stupendous rate of 7%) in his/her corporation is not so well off now eh? Assuming he/she holds $750k in personal assets, they will be able to enjoy a pension comparable to a retired civil servant after taking far greater risks over their career.

"Question:  How does 'EVERY taxpayer' subsidize a political donation tax credit?  Especially when the current government runs deliberate bloated deficits during relatively steady economic times, there is a complex relationship between the responsibility of current and future taxpayers in relation to government tax revenues, and the very question of who owns the benefit of a tax deduction or tax credit plays into the analysis.

Napoleon III (Louis-Napoleon) was emperor of the French in the middle of the 19th century and is responsible for rebuilding Paris, including tearing down much of older Paris, expanding its boulevards and requiring buildings along them to be of the same height, building the Paris Opera, refurbishing the four central parks and building four very large parks on the outskirts of the city. As a result of the parks on the outskirts, Paris has a very large percentage of green space. However, this is primarily used by and was intended for the use of Parisians.  What attracts tourists is central Paris, including its old central parks as well as its buildings, museums,  churches, ambience etc, as well as Versailles, not the parks on the outskirts.  Tourists don't much rent car and drive around the outskirts of Paris.",0

It is time to stop saying that fighting climate change is some kind of luxury add-on, that fighting climate change is nothing but a drag on the economy. Climate change is a runaway train. It is accelerating and we need to do more, faster. If we don't act faster the economy will be even more seriously damaged, and a lot more than that will be harmed.  We also need public education, and transparency in compliance and an enforcement mechanism.",0

It does show that complexity and rules designed for those with great wealth, simply aren't a part of the options for most of us who live primarily on wages.   Complexity is a cover for wealth, not just of Republicans.   The election has shown that the Democratic party is having no problem raising money under current campaign financing laws.   To take advantage of that wealth for campaign support, while saying it is corrupt, is really hypocritical.  Neither party will give up the right to create new tax's, or tax avoidance, as a tool to gain favor with powerful interest groups.

"Outsider, Here is another historical lesson that American's should sit up and think about that is related to CR's thoughts. When the anti-Federalists lost the ratification debate, they did not rebel (which they could have done), riot, whine, pout, and carry-on. They accepted the results of the process.  Later, when the grand children of the anti-Federalist's found the rule of the Federal government intolerable and tried to secede peacefully, then forcefully, and then lost the Civil War, they did not keep on fighting via a guerrilla war. They accepted the results of force of arms and came back into the Union and worked the system via rule of law. The anti-Federalists have been losing but shaping this experiment in self-government since the end of the American War for Independence. There will always be this balancing act between individual liberty and the common good. When the scales tip too far to one side or the other we will have either right or left totalitarianism.",0

"Let me respond to ixtlan's comment regarding homelessness.  One reason government has been unsuccessful in resolving homelessness (and its related issues) is because it doesn't want to appear ""insensitive."" So it allows people to consistently break the law. It also lets people camp and monopolize areas, which then become unsanitary and unsafe. Often in life, doing the nice thing and not the right thing leads to greater, unintended consequences.  In addition, when government does take the ""insensitive"" approach (which to the majority is sometimes needed) some people will deliberately mischaracterize its' actions for their own political purpose. Not so much to help the homeless or clean up the neighborhood but to feel relevant in promoting their own cause or ""dislike of government.""",0

"True, the industrial revolution in Europe was somewhat earlier than the migration to Africa. Yet the only real ""advanced technology"" were the more advanced weapons. Most importantly, there was an ""intellectual capital"", i.e. the ability to devise new technology, due to better education (trade schools, universities), better agricultural know-how, maritime know-how,  transportation know-how (i.e. the wheel), economics know-how (money), and the accumulated and codified brain power of centuries (mathematics, physics,chemistry  in the form of written records). This in my mind are hallmarks of a civilization which was suitable to European conditions of the time. In Africa there was small-scale agriculture, plant-based medicine, local  markets, animal husbandry (animal products, skins), and in some areas mining and metal working. So there was civilization as a socially and methodically organized activity of the level which was satisfactory enough for local conditions.",0

Commit to buy 24 F-15E'S and base them with the Yanks at RAF Lakenheath for the next ten years until the F-35 's mature. Give the Used F-15E's to the Yanks when we transition to F-35's. 2. Exercise the option on 100 TAPV's to equip our Reserve units. Made in America. 3. Buy the last white Tail C-17 in Texas to augment the other 5 we own. 4. Commit to a Submarine replacement program of 8 boats to train the USN and patrol Canadian waters 5. Replace the 199 Bison's and 284 M113a4's with new Combat support vehicles.,0

"The best is at the end:  ""Spicer remained loyal to Trump but he frequently battled perceptions that he was not plugged in to what the president was thinking, and had to worry that Trump was watching and critiquing his performance from the Oval Office.  Throughout the start of the administration, there was always the possibility that Trump would undermine something Spicer said by simply sending out a tweet.""  I would worry for Spicer if he were plugged into what Trump was thinking because he would have to change his briefings on the fly while he was giving them.

"DECOLONIZATION  What about regaining full independence (soveteignty) through decolonization? This has happened many many times over the past 300 years.

At one point you mentioned taking immigrants for Vancouver ""from a wide range of nations"".   There is nothing wrong with that, but I think that also there is nothing wrong with taking lots of immigrants from just one location.  My example is Hong Kong a few decades ago. What Canada did was disgusting, selfish and obscene. What Canada said was ""Ooh, how sad, Hong Kong is about to be taken over by brutal overlords in Beijing, we will help out by accepting all Hong Kong millionaires who can afford our price tag, and everybody else there can rot and die under Beijing's boot"".  In other words, I would have been okay with having the SAME high number of folks accepted from Hong Kong at that time, but PROPORTIONATELY REPRESENTATIVE of Canada's own WEALTH strata  (fraction of middle class, etc).",0

Then vulture real-estate flippers from out of state got creative and re-marketed the project as condos for retirees--which could be bought for next to nothing, quite literally-- but most condos had been foreclosed and abandoned.  Vail and Aspen Ski bums bought a few condos with their daddies' money, they moved in and started making their own macrame clothes and growing their own weed-- but most of the housing set empty for years until the early 90's, since there were no jobs. That economy has ran another full cycle by now.   Don't forget who brung ya' to the dance in the first place.",0

If people were paying attention they would have seen that the only possible way to raise the money needed to fund the state is to collect our fair share of oil revenue.  Robin Brena has already explained that if we were getting our historic share of oil profit,there would be no crisis.  The legislature has shown us with their spending habits, they are not concerned about solving the state budget crisis.

"This is a disturbing ruling. It says a lot that Wikipedia, the entire news industry, and the Attorney-General of Canada all sided with Google, and the court ruled the other way. Digital freedom advocacy groups such as the EFF and OpenMedia also supported Google's position.  So basically, *the entire Internet* is saying ""this ruling would be really bad for the Internet."" But there you have it.  It is really quite shocking. Can a Canadian court now decide what information an Australian resident can access from an Argentinian web server? How would we feel about Chinese court rulings deciding what information Canadians can access?  What is left now, would the Liberals be inclined to legislate over this ruling?",0

The US on the other hand subsidises Boeing and others through military contracts and would not hesitate to bail them out if they got into trouble like they have with car manufacturers and banks.  The issue in my mind is that Bombardier has repeatedly come back to the well vs only coming in an emergency. This indicates a chronic management problem.   Secondly, the loosy goosy loan arrangements just look like a subsidy and attract retaliation (from US and Brazil).  The Federal and Quebec governments should take a more disciplined approach with Bombardier. Put assets up for collateral and establish a firm loan repayment scheme. This will be positive for taxpayers and keep them out of hot water with our free trade partners. If the government ends up owning it because of default - no problem.

Ever since my ancestors have been surviving off the long winters and harsh climate, with barely any food, I've long respected their bravery and persistence. And to hear that my grandparents, that went through torturous assimilation from our Western friends, disgusts me. Not only that, to hear the comments and opinions of those who do not have the right to judge my relatives' lifestyles, further annoys me.

So, basically, we no longer get a dividend PLUS we have to pay the state the same amount as the dividend.  Got it.  Who in this government actually thinks this is a good plan?  I just want to start my list of people who aren't getting any votes at the next election.",0

This pro-bicycle nut job mayor who owned a house in Point Grey asked  Vancouver city council toapprove a pedestrian/bicycle/local car owners only ordinance on his street. Of course he didn't vote on it, but all his cronies did. It immediately added a couple million dollars (certainly over a million) to the value of the home, over night. He is all about what is good for Gregor Robertson / what HE wants people to have rather than what they want. He has had built segregated bike lanes in the downtown core that no one uses. They congest traffic and I can see directly out my window ambulances and fire trucks delayed because vehicles can't get out of the way on the more congested streets; bad enough that ambulances and fire trucks sometimes just turn off their sirens because there is no point having them on, they aren't moving until a light changes further up.

Unfortunately, reality doesn't work that way. Under unlicensed traffic engineer Tom Larsen, we saw an unchanging number of deaths with a constant 50% of them being vulnerable road users in spite of a dramatic 37% decline in cycling.

If they paid a premium for oil just because it's Canadian, that would simply increase fuel costs and harm the economy -- while having no economic benefit.  Similarly, it makes no sense for Newfoundland to sell Irving oil for cheap if they can get a better price from the Yanks and the Brits.

Using data from federal health agencies in 47 states, the latest number is (for 2013) 12.5 pregnancy terminations per one thousand women ages 15 to 44 years.  By contract that number is down 5% from 2012, and HALF the rate from 1980.  The  Church must be the point of pro-life dialogue and not trying to dictate social policy.  Of course, the foolish prohibition against birth control only serves to diminish our prophetic voice and create the consequence of many women getting pregnant and then needing to obtain an abortion, all when it could have been avoided (and don't enter the argument of abstaining from sex here, as it is  ridiculous position).

Their website did assert that there are 10K illegal immigrants in Alaska, but said that the cost to the State  was 137 million not the 177 million you assert. Why the discrepancy; just wondering? In looking through their website, it was unclear how they came up with the numbers. I researched FAIRus further and was astonished to find the following. Their founder, John Trenton is friendly to Holocaust deniers, formerly served as a lawyer for the KKK and is asserted to be a leading white nationalist. Fairus appears to promote hatred of all immigrants, especially non-white ones. The highly respected and credible Southern Poverty Law Center considers them a hate group, promoting xenophobia and natavism.

Since LTD begun their focus on EmX projects and proposals, they have been forced to cut 19% of their basic transit service, have lost about 10% ridership, and yet still have added administrative LTD staff.  The transit agency currently has a $26 million in unfunded pension and OPEB liability as reported on their balance sheet.",0
"Without a doubt, this statement from Trump--“The media lies to make it look like I am against ‘Intelligence’ when in fact I am a big fan!”--constitute some of the worst writing from a president we've ever seen. The man doesn't know that ""media"" is the plural form of ""medium""; he sarcastically places ""intelligence"" in quotation marks even though a moment later he says he is a fan of intelligence (making the use of sarcastic quotation marks pointless); his use of an exclamation point is sophomoric; and the phrase 'big fan' reflects skill in description that hovers around a grade 6 level. And, worse, no, not all media outlets are saying what he says they are saying (specific examples, please). And there is also the rank hypocrisy of his calling anyone else a liar when he has been caught countless times in shameless, straight-to-camera, lying.   Sad. <That's an ironic usage of the adjective, Donald.  Do you understand the term?   4 years to come of this garbage.  U.S.A.!  U.S.A.!",0

"The state does not have the funding to build separate facilities for transgenders, or to fund whatever treatment the person or their doctors decide they need. Neither would it be reasonable to house a biological male with females.  The moral here is not that the state should be responsible for giving every possible permutation of inmate whatever they think they need due to the state having arrested and convicted them; but rather that a person should not do things that will put them in jail, especially if they won't be able to deal with prison conditions or pay for their special needs themselves, if allowable.  This should be thrown out of court immediately. Somehow, I doubt that is what will happen. Instead, a judge will take it upon himself/herself to require funding for this person, a clear violation of their duties since the legislature should decide the issue and fund this, or not.

Iraq is a good example of how to effectively use our defense capabilities with limited budget to maximum advantage.  And while I am on the topic of the military.

"Since there are something in the neighborhood of 60 share-a-ride vans that come in from the Valley, it wouldn't seem to be too difficult to re-position a number of them at the railroad depot in Anchorage to help facilitate cross-town traffic.  Palmer already has a station at the fairgrounds, and Wasilla has already been looking to move the train stop there to the corner of Palmer-Wasilla Hwy and the Parks; so instead of meeting the van at the park and ride lot, Valley commuters could go to the train.  It would cut the number of miles the vans travel, and gas, oil, maintenance, and replacement costs.  It would also be a good way to avoid the long delays for winter ditch divers and other accidents, and should be a lot less expensive than adding additional lanes of pavement to accommodate increased passenger car traffic.  Good coffee and wi-fi on a self-propelled car could be pretty popular.  Let's look at transportation as a whole, not one mode at a time.",0

Hey, look Robert Griffin doesn't have a job, either, ignoring the fact that RGIII stinks as a player.  In my view, owners are reluctant to employ Kaepernick not only because of potential distractions, but also because they don't want to upset their sponsers and fans.

"The issue isn't one of partisanship; Chad is simply--and appropriately--examining the actions of an elected representative. There is a valid question why Schatz, a self-proclaimed progressive, voted to block progress on this vital issue. It is inconsistent with his previous positions to argue that the costly and damaging status quo is preferable to pushing forward toward a more responsible stance on foreign engagements. Just as the perfect is the enemy of the good, the lazy is the enemy of the active. Hirono and Hanabusa stepped up, as expected. Gabbard's position is less satisfying, but again largely what we have come to expect from her. This should raise serious questions about why Schatz voted as he did, whether he is truly representing the majority of Hawaii voters, and if there is some pressure pushing him in a troubling new direction.",0

Oh, and according to Baseball-Reference.com, he was a position player in 553 of the 810 regular season games since the start of 2012. That's 81 games at DH, or another half-season of NOT playing in the field.  So fewer than 3 1/2 seasons out of last 5 to play defence -- maybe a good thing, considering his precipitous decline in fielding and arm strength.  If they hadn't signed the aging Morales, then permanent DH would have been a way to keep his bat and OBP in the game.  No youth, no bullpen replacements, a switch-hitter for part-time LH bat, and still no corner outfielder for Saunders and JB. Sure hope the kids and the rotation repeat their 2016 success.",0

"""The straw that broke the camel's back"" was, according to one Gulf official, the fact that the Qataris paid a $1bn ransom for the release of 25 members of the royal family who were taken hostage while on a hunting trip in Iraq. Around $700m of this went to Iranian figures and the Shia militias they support. The rest went to Islamist movements in the region (source: Financial Times). All in all very convoluted but demonstrates that Qatar's willingness to play both sides of the Shia - Sunni street is a major source of frustration - at least to the Sunni side.   It is also worth noting that, while all politics may be local, the LNG angle here has global implications. The Japanese, who account for c1/3 of global imports, have sought and received assurances that the flow of LNG from Qatar, the world's largest exporter, will continue unabated. In April Qatar lifted a ban on developing the world's largest gas field, a field it shares jointly with Iran.",0

I make no judgements about anyone's choice of 'poison'; I myself like wine, a nice dry red.  Pot lounges have every right to exist, but they are different from bars.  If I want to socialize with friends at a bar, I don't have to drink just because they are drinking.  But at a 'pot lounge' it is impossible not to partake, so I must exclude myself, and that impacts the friendship.  That brings up another point: how does a group appoint a 'designated non-smoker' at a pot lounge?",0
"This is an unrealistic and dangerous proposition:  there is zero chance of cutting the state budget to its funding levels under the current oil ""tax"" code, no income tax, no sales tax.  You can lay off 100% of state employees, but not come close to balancing the budget.  Tax reform is key:  end paying oil companies for losses in past years (the state should NOT assume the risk of a private enterprise in the first place) - and generate revenue from MORE than just residents.  I ""fair tax"" (a modified sales tax) is probably best - but it alone would not be enough to pay what the state needs.  However - it WOULD generate money from ALL visitors - spreading the tax load to non-Alaskan residents.  An income tax would also generate money from non-resident workers - which remarkably do exist in some numbers - also helping spread the tax burden a bit.  The governor - at least privately - admits we need both.  He is correct.",0

If your narrative does not resonate sufficiently with others to a point where they agree with you then they will carry an election. The 'far right' (as well as the 'far left') is a limited constituency and it's influence is only one of many on the electorate. The notion that 'Fundamentalist Christianity' is an overwhelming factor in the political revolution that we have just witnessed is a bit of a canard given the number of  US voters the cast ballots in favour of the new president. More to the point, it was distaste for establishment complacency that drove the decision along with a repudiation of the liberal/left/progressive agenda. In short, the electorate was fed-up and Trump was carried to power on disaffection with the entire system. There is, however, no evidence that the majority of the  electorate will tolerate or welcome  the imposition of  non-secular limitations on their lives.",0

If a new contract is issued that creates a disincentive for suppressing cat populations, I'd have to ask that a population study be conducted to determine how many feral cats we now have, how many we need to kill to keep the population from growing beyond an acceptable level, and a thorough opinion survey to find out how many residents quietly, politely, and with good reason agree that cats have to be managed for public health--it's a civic duty.

"Here we go making uneven comparisons to try & push married priests onto our religion, acting innocent, while we ignore the most obvious question:  Is ordaining married clergy in our church Just, or not?  Then asking is it better for priests or parish?  The first question is the most important one & the answer is NO!    Why?  Because ordaining married people in our church before we are ordaining women priests means we are literally creating Segregation by Gender.   This makes our religion one in which one sex has complete authority & sacramental power over the other.  This is not true in Presbyterian & other religions that have married clergy because they already ordain women priests & ministers.    We must, in order not to create a graver sin against women's humanity than we have, take a stand to not ordain married men, as a matter of human justice, until we are ordaining women priests too.  Catholicism saves no one, if we are still treating our sisters with hatred & bias.",0

Read  G&M Eric  Reguly's  article in the Business section  on the proposed failed attempt by Kraft to  take over Unilever.  Says it all about he Buccaneering schemes by Conglomerates in the take over business. This article  is also a wake up call for Canadians.  The example is shown  of what happened to the old established British company Cadbury which has been around for  over a hundred years after their takeover by Kraft.  Lay offs and outsourcing production to Poland is causing great resentment in the U.K.   The British Prime Minister is not too happy as Kraft Executives promised to keep confectionary  production  in  the U.K.   Comments in the U.K. media  are full of  complaints about the lower quality of their products since the take over.

Had Bush not torn up the agreement we might not be in the situation we are in with North Korea.   And why did the neocon's want to target North Korea? Because North Korea is an ally of Iran - Israel's arch enemy. So we can see every American foreign policy is made based on what Israel want's - not was is good for America.

Edit: Listen, I'm glad you could have that kind of childhood. That's the kind of childhood we should work for as a country to provide to every single American.

And it is a myth to pretend that Christianity provided that childhood in the US.",0

If one or both parents had legal citizesship, the child has at worse duo citizenship.  This shouldn't be a liberal/conservative split, but we've made it into that.

Certainly the anti-fluoride coalition P.A. depend more on self-identified liberal voters than on conservatives. But there are differences in their fears. On the right, these from fear of government.

"Programming languages are a teaching tool that lets you objectively demonstrate critical thinking. You can illustrate -- plain as day! -- how logic works, how the assumptions one makes when forming an opinion affects the result of that opinion, how to break down a question into its constituent parts, etc.. You are basically telling a computer how to ""think"" about something.  That said, you have to be teaching the right things. If the goal is ""make a web page and learn HTML"" then I agree, that is of limited use. If the goal is ""learn how to work with variables, functions and flow control in Python, then -- if we have time -- hook the inputs and outputs up to a web app"" then that is teaching a broad range of logic skills, with minimal technical involvement (Python's syntax is very easy to understand).",0

But since those targeted folks don't pay much in taxes, we are really hearing about greater wealth re-distribution through manipulation of the Oregon tax code.  People who pay next to nothing will get increasingly greater refunds of other taxpayer's money.  Pure socialism.  Why give up any money the state is legally entitled to during this current budget ""crisis ""?  This is not the time for tax cuts for anyone.  About 250,000 returns are filed every year by people who owe no state tax;  they file a return to get free money from the state.  We don't call it a redistribution of wealth or socialism but that is what is going on in Salem under Democrat control.

The use of oil and gas increased in all years where the economy was doing well and went down when he economy was doing poorly.  There is a better correlation between GDP and energy use, which should show governments that the key to a good economy is affordable, reliable energy and that energy is a need not a luxury.  People need energy - to heat homes, go places, have goods delivered to stores etc.  There are no affordable, reliable energy substitutes with zero emissions  that are currently even in a pilot stage that could power he world.  One example for Canadians is home heating.   Natural gas is between $3 & $4/GJ.  The equivalent electric furnace, taking into account efficiency, would be the equivalent of $40/GJ in Ontario.  So unless the Carbon tax is over 1000%, no one would make a switch to heating with an electrical furnace if natural gas is an option.",0

"Wolf Eagle, you are way off track. See my other post as to why many areas restrict harvest to full-curl rams. ""Any sheep,"" ""any ram,"" and ""any ram with at least 3/4 or 7/8 curl"" hunts used to be more common in Alaska, but now most areas restrict harvests to full-curl rams. Hunting needs to be limited for several reasons, primarily because it is popular (i.e., many hunters apply for permits), nobody wants to see too many hunters chasing a small number of legal sheep, and because sheep hunters (and sheep watchers) would like to see more sheep in the mountains, not less. We used to have hunts specifically for ewes in the Chugach Mountains, but they had to be suspended about 10 years ago because the number of sheep started to decline precipitously.  Not because of the hunting, but for the reasons mentioned in the article. No one hunts ewes for their horns. Finally, most sheep hunters are not wealthy. The local Dena'ina prized sheep meat and subsistence hunting is still practiced in Alaska.",0

"I am not vey knowledgeable about how the risk of CMHC insured mortgages is shared. However, if the lender is 100% absolved of any loss in the event of a default, that is a problem.  The US RE meltdown was largely due to fraudulent lending practices precisely because the firms approving the mortgages were not the ones a risk.  I am a supporter of the CMHC concept but it seems logical to make sure that the lender will always be required to share in a least a portion of the risk.  The apparent interest rate variance in favor of smaller down payments defies logic. If the lender was always assuming some risk, that variance would probably not exist.",0

"Sue Scherwin - By whom? The GOP swept the House, Senate and White House on the promise that they would repeal Obamacare. You can check the polls, it was the number one reason voters gave for voting GOP in the last three election cycles. So, if the GOP votes to keep Obamacare, the voters (most of whom are being crushed by huge premium increases and loss of coverage as insurers leave the marketplace) will punish them in the next election.  Of course, if they vote for the American Health Care Act, which is basically Obama-lite that will speed the death spiral rather than stop it, the voters will punish them at the next election.  The only way the GOP wins on Obamacare is if they repeal it totally and either don't replace it (which the market will equalize the premiums fairly quickly) or replace it with something along the lines of Rand Paul's bill over in the Senate. GOP voters will NOT accept the continuation of Obamacare. They can't afford it and the GOP promised it would go away.",0

China's government is still a dictatorship and compared to the US, China still lacks the basic legal framework and intellectual property laws that make the US the world's economic leader.

China's government also competes unfairly through state-owned companies.  Countries do business with China because of China's huge population, not because China is great place to do business. The fact is, most countries don't trust China's government on trade and China will not be a leader until they modernize their laws and approach.",0

Freedom of religion does not entitle anyone to build a church, cemetery or shrine wherever they wish.

None of our most fundamental Canadian freedoms grant one an unrestricted right to do what one wishes on a piece of land.  Freedom of religion means that federal and provincial governments will not discriminate against you in any way regardless of your beliefs. But when it comes to ACTING on your beliefs, that's another matter. Your actions must conform to all manner of laws and regulations, regardless of what your religious beliefs may be.

Now, the feds have more coming in than going out. That will reduce the deficit and create a surplus. But, there must be a caveat for reduced taxes. There must be a stipulation that this incentive is to create job opportunities.  A smaller government requires less income.

Never in the modern history of US politics has a president been more opposed by such a large swath of ""his own"" party (even though it's often not prudent to declare it out loud).  If Trump decides not to run for reelection, million of R's will quietly cheer since we never wanted him as the nominee in the first place.",0

Because Boeing has a substantial backlog amounting to billions of dollars and is hardly a crippled company due to competition in the single aisle market, where it is absent. In the meantime, it is entirely possible that Delta might be forced to cancel the contract with Bombardier. The editorial fails to mention that the U.S. laws require proof of substantial harm, which Boeing is hardly in a position to supply. Of course that process could play out long enough to put Bombardier out of business if the Chinese are unwilling to buy it. Fat chance of that.",0

There would be strong US lobbies to simply cancel NAFTA unless all US demands were met.

Secondly, we can only hope to accommodate a small token number of refugees.

When talking about cutting services in order to balance the budget, maybe some of that should focus on efficiency as well.  If we are going to try to draw new commercial investors, there is a pretty high level of life-style and infrastructure that we will need to maintain in order to be attractive.  The other end of the slope is that we will all be living a subsistence life-style; 2. I am not sure about the cost we pay for the resources to provide our own energy, but at the gas pump we certainly don't see the benefits of our own resources.  Any role renewables can play seems beneficial for those who's energy costs are already high. One more thing, but out of ""characters"".",0

Also, your information is wrong. Victims/survivors of abuse cannot prevent their partners from harming them no matter how nicely they try to work out their problems. Indeed, it is the failure of marriage counseling and anger management programs to recognize and address the abusers pattern of control that makes Womenspace and batterer intervention programs essential.",0

"The per-vote subsidy should be in place for many reasons: - The current individual donation and tax credit system tilts all fundraising to the ones who can afford the donation (the well-heeled Conservative (especially) as well as many Liberal supporters).  Without money, do you have a voice? - Taxpayers already pay for three-quarters of a political donation, and almost all those donations come to well-heeled donors who don't need the subsidy. - With all the tax credits, the current system of super-deductions is likely as costly (don't forget administrative costs, as well) - It eliminates cash for access - It eliminates the discrepancies in our tax receipt structure where any donation to the Fraser Institute is fully deductible for tax purposes, yet a donation to the Broadbent Institute is not deductible.  Why is that? - Political parties can get on with policy and analysis, not worrying about fundraising - Set a minimum threshold for support, say 1 or 2% overall of the overall vote",0

It is not easy to defend the concept that soldiers should not attack ""innocent"" civilians when those civilians are not actually so innocent.  Indeed, one reason why Denby's story is so inspirational is because it shows that even the sweet, gentle lei sellers were patriots serving the military machine.

The selling point for these systems is they're 'rapid' - buses in dedicated lanes are not going to get stuck in traffic like other motorists, so people would want to use them, and it's cheaper than private car (fuel, wear & tear, long travelling times on congested roads).  Note other cities w/ functioning, efficient mass bus systems like London and Rome don't use dedicated lanes except here and there. So there's your billions, not overpriced tenders.

"Be honest and ask yourself: What is a ""responsible drinker?  In all fairness to pot smokers, the main reason to smoke or ingest these things is an ""effect"" on the human body.  ""Responsible"" drinkers would hardly support the vast alcohol industry and all the ""effects"" of alcohol, both good and bad, have been well-documented. The ""bad effects"" contribute to the imbalance of insurance, health care and long-term detriments to society everywhere in the world. Those who have studied the ""effects"" of pot ingestion worldwide, see some similarities but not the degree of devastation of alcohol abuse.  The ""responsible drinker"" comes up against one serious problem; the tolerance effect of alcohol.  In order to achieve the same ""effect"" long-term, I think it is well-documented that larger doses are needed.  So logically, a ""responsible drinker"" is one who never builds tolerances, e.g. not drinking for the ""effect."" Both pot and alcohol users drink for ""effect"" - a fact, for better or worse.",0

Guy and others need to really read into what Zoo employees said was Flemings issues with the zoo - Fleming had complained about his frustration working with the city to achieve improvements the zoo needed to keep its accreditation - That is going to be an issue no matter who you hire at this point.

Not so fast.  A couple who itemizes with an amount close to the new $24000 standard deduction would better off with the present tax system because the personal exemptions would be an added write off.  The exemptions plus the itemized deduction would easily top the new $24000 deduction with no exemptions.  Couples with older dependents not entitled to child tax credits and with student loans would lose without the personal exemptions.  Simple math.,0

"I had emergency surgery two and a half years ago for a ruptured abdominal abscess caused by a stage 3 colon tumour that had been missed by colonoscopy screening. Although it was very serious, it wasn't as serious as what the writer went through (while no one discussed whether or not I would recover from the surgery at the time, I'm on palliative chemo, so I am staring impending death in the face). Still, I recognize some of the things mentioned. An oncology nurse told me that she likes her job because cancer patients are some of the easiest patients to manage: they appreciate everything done for them and tend to forgive mistakes and just let things that would bother other patients roll off their backs. I think that serious illness makes many people realize how precious life is and that it is too short to be spent feeling angry about anything, or trying to change anyone.",0

The Health Minister's mandate charges her with  introducing plain packaging for tobacco products. That is the only concrete thing in the mandate. The rest of it was to ""support"" and ""promote"" various things that are mostly of provincial jurisdiction.  So yes, it makes sense that the  funding of actual patient care would use up most of the budget.",0

"Democratic Socialism is an oxymoron.  It is a silly phrase made up to market an old man to young people.  In 1919, there were about 3,500 libraries in the United States of America.  A little less than half this number, about 1,700, were built by Andrew Carnegie.  Carnegie, who founded Carnegie Steel, which became United States Steel was hardly a socialist.  Sanders gets away with saying that the existence of libraries in America is proof of socialism, because most of his followers have not taken the time or effort to find out what he is talking about.  Government has an important role in protecting us against those who would use their positions of power to poison our food or water.  But, it  should not take over industries that are functioning fairly well.  Fix what is broken.  Take the states out of Medicaid.  Fund care for the poor.

Since September 11, 2001, we have had, in total, fewer than 10,000 deaths due to terrorism of all kinds, including service personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan.  In that same time period there have been roughly 500,000 firearms deaths in the US, of which more than 220,000 have been murders.  The number of accidental deaths due to children playing with firearms in the US is roughly the same as the number killed by terrorists.

By reporting direct ear-witness evidence of purported conduct regarding a person who, for 3 years, flew out to be with her boyfriend,  to his direct supervisor, even though no police reports accessible to him, not any reports of any arrests corroborating her story, he did all that he could do. He CERTAINLY couldn't have contacted law enforcement, as then the evidence would have become hearsay, even in a preliminary phase, not could he have terminated Tumpkin, as that would have given Tumpkin Carte Blanche to sue the school for unlawful termination, since he was not an at-will employee and had extrajudicial rights to due process embedded in his contract.

The ability to better forecast improves things like farming and military so there is a return on the science in addition to the economic side.,0

"It is typically $30.00 from Airport Heights to the airport and the same to return upon finishing the trip.  $60.00 round trip, and that includes about $3.00 to $4.00 in tips for the drivers each way, so around $26.00 to $27.00 each way to the taxi company.  There is some danger involved in driving hack, so I don't consider the tip to be excessive.  I've only recently started using taxi's to get back and forth to the airport, and I don't usually use taxis for transportation otherwise. When I do, the vehicle is typically quite worn out.  I certainly don't consider a taxi to be a comfortable ride.  So, is this excessive when it comes to cost?  if so, then maybe some changes are warranted.",0

"Of course it's possible.  After NE, there's no reason to think that DEN isn't right there in the mix with OAK, PIT, and KC as the 2nd best team in the AFC.  So much depends on injuries and breaks though.  Fine line between being 9-7 and out of the playoffs (like last year) vs winning a close division with 10 or 11 wins.  Or going 12-4 and being the #1 seed as they were in 2015 en route to being SB champs.    Something unexpected would likely need to take place with NE to get past them though.  Every team is just one season-ending injury to a great player away from having their season ruined.  So ya never know.   I think it's certainly possible DEN could win 2 or 3 more games than they did last year.  Not saying I EXPECT it, but there's certainly a fair chance.

I would note that the costs of the two programs we will be talking about also include indirect costs of increases in contracts with many of the non-profits that provide many of our human services that have many part-time and minimum wage employees. Multiply that times 36 counties and 200+ incorporated cities in Oregon and it adds up to a pretty big unfunded mandate.

I think Denver has shown enough good things to be optimistic and hopefully look for more improvement for the offense. They are a strong team and can compete with the Chiefs but everything has to go right. Chiefs/Broncos traditionally go to the wire and usually decided by a big play or turnover. Smith is foolish to be running the ball the way he is and I wonder why Reid lets him anyway. On the same thought I would take it easy on CJ for awhile and use him mostly in the first and fourth Qtrs. I feel that's when your running game needs to set the pace of the game. I feel he has nothing really to prove except stay healthy. 292 carries would be pushing your luck. Why?  I'd sure like to see a healthy CJ towards the end for a possible late season push. He can start and set the pace in the first Qtr and let Booker and Charles get reps and come back and close out the game hopefully with a win. It really helps to have all the backs to carry the load.

"Football fans do not pay for football, regardless.  The costs and debt for football are astronomical and paid for by tuition.  We'll see in a year, Honey Doodles, how packed that stadium is.

They predicted profits going out 30 years!!!! But still not enough to cover the nearly $8 million annual debt for football (that they admit) or the finance debt of $12 million per year.     Fun with numbers, even if the report was highly dishonest, cherry picked schools for each category and wouldn't pass an undergraduate statistics class. And hey - it didn't include that 100% of the $225 million was borrowed.  So, football fans do not pay for football as is true for over 200 Div 1 FBS schools.  Tuition and student debt pays.",0

Nor should dirty industries have carte blanche to dump their waste - if those businesses don't have the ethics to do it themselves, they need to be policed.

Modern toilets use 1.28 gallons per flush - compared to old toilets that use 3.5 to 5 gals/flush. Change out all of Freeland's old toilets, residential and commercial, and see how much sewage is left to be treated.

The mantra is false and you know it   People are struggling with taxation saturation :  if less than 1 percent are already paying for a third of the tax base who pay nothing something is amiss.    Please  consider a creative solution :  how about a maximum amount payable of $100,000 for individuals   I don't mind the progressive rates but when does it end for individuals   Is $100,000 fair ... $200,000....

Whenever I see a strike, knowing of the many factors that can lead to a complete collapse of the union or the strike, and see a workforce standing together long enough to march on the picket line I know there is something up with management which is causing the worker dissatisfaction.

And without stalling, as that unforgiving ground comes up at you so fast. At 1000', at least you have a chance to try a re-start and to pick a landing spot.  I see air taxi cowboys all the time yanking their craft around at a few hundred feet on takeoff.

The problem is that they cannot point to even one current or historical example of a government that functions as they imagine it should. They have no real world examples, so they ply their arguments as a theoretical construct.

Teachers in high-cost districts would also be eligible for a housing allowance of up to $10,000.  - The elimination of levy equalization dollars.  - Repeal of I-1351, a class-size reduction measure passed by voters in 2014.  - Prohibits teacher strikes.  - Beginning in 2020, school districts to go to voters requesting “excess” levy dollars for non-basic education spending items, subject to a uniform 10 percent levy lid.""

"While I condemn violence against women in all its forms, no matter who the perpetrators are, there is a major difference between men who commit violence against women in the west, as compared to violence committed against women in Islam. For one, men who abuse women in the west, do it alone, there is not generally family members involved.  In fact, the evidence shows that a man who is abusive tries to isolate the woman from family & friends in order to hide the abuse & emotional manipulation.  In Islam, as your article has pointed out, family members are complicit in the abuse & murder & have no issues with carrying out the acts, even mothers of the girls.  Women in Islam who report abuse are shunned by their families & communities, are the ones blamed for causing the aggression in the first place. In the west, the taking of a life is murder no matter what the reason & punished accordingly. Islam does not recognize murder of women because it is their fault for ""shaming"" the family.",1

"Continued - Two unfunded wars? There was one war with two fronts, Iraq and Afghanistan and they were both funded with much whining and complaining from the democrats. The spending for the war has always been included in government spending figures. The economic collapse was a result of a large number of very large banks and financial institutions investing in junk mortgages and then the whole thing collapsed taking other large segments of the economy down too. While there are some factors that contributed to the collapse by both parties, neither party actually had a major part in the collapse.  By the way, the Bush deficits went like this, FY2002 - 157 billion, FY2003 - 377 billion, FY2004 - 412 billion, FY2005 - 318 billion, FY2006 - 248 billion, FY2007 - 161 billion, FY2008 - 458 billion, FY2009 - 1.4 trillion.

"Neither does Europe, but none of us were ever democratically consulted as to whether we agree with the generous (terribly naive) asylum policies of our respective governments and the supranational  EU supremos. In fact, this is a reason why the British voted for ""Brexit"", among other. The problem is that a majority of Canadians voted for socialist Trudeau, who will doubtlessly be inspired by the likes of Angela Merkel and other similar humanitarian idealists - most of whom are unwilling to distinguish between genuine refugees (war and persecution) and economic migrants: both seem to stay ad infinitum, without any real justification based on the UN Refugee Convention. As usual, it will be the wider population that will suffer the adverse consequences in the future. At least in Canada, there is still time to swing the pendulum if enough of you voice loud and clear opposition to illegal immigration, and the not so desirable ""cultural enrichment"" linked to this worrying development.",0

Finally a follow up story. Thank-You Mr. Miller.,0
"Reciprocity on trade is probably not a bad thing. What is bad is when it is misapplied.  The US gained much under NAFTA but with any trade deal there are winning and losing sectors. Also there are factors that cannot be controlled, like automation and changing consumer demand. The problem the US now faces is that the Russian Candidate is backing the losers.   No amount of bilateral dealing will help the losers. It will not change the fact that coal is now facing serious competition from solar power. Automation of manufacturing is only partly complete and likely to continue for another decade.   If creating jobs is the aim of bilateral deals the US will come up short every time if only because of the slow and steady loss already happening..",0
