"Paul: Thank you for your kind words.  I do, indeed, have strong beliefs and don't hide them.  They are based on both facts and values.  I think the question of ""bias"" and ""prejudice"" comes into play when we're discussing beliefs and attitudes based on values.  One of our poster friends,  for example, often comments that being ""intolerant"" of a bias, for example, is, in itself, a bias.  This is, IMO, where the concept of ""irratonal antipathy"" is important.  If I dislike neo-Nazis because of their views on race, my antipathy is based on fact (knowledge of their views) and values (my belief that condemning others because of their race/religion is WRONG).  Were I to, instead, dislike all Germans, that, IMO, would represent a bias...an irrational antipathy...since not all Germans condemn others because of their race/religion.  I discuss the ""bias"" question in another response to you....  It's an interesting topic and I'd enjoy discussing it w/you sometime.  Give me a call.  Gary Crum",0
Sorry you missed high school. Eisenhower sent troops to Vietnam after the French withdrew in 1954 and before that America was providing 50% of the cost of that war. WWI & WWII were won by Democrat Presidents and the last win a Republican had was 1865  but the did surrender in Korea and Vietnam and fail to win in desert Storm or these two wars.,0
Let’s see if I understand this; Berkowitz announces a $14M surplus then he rails against Proposition 8 because it would constrain his ability to confiscate even more money from citizens. Berkowitz and his allies on the Assembly changed the tax cap language to facilitate confiscating greater amounts of citizen’s money. Now why would a mayor who professes fidelity with the taxpayers change the law to enable him to take more money from them? Probably because he plans to take more money from them.  Berkowitz said if Proposition 8 passes “it severely constrains our ability to give out property tax relief.”  So Berkowitz wants the ability to confiscate more of the citizen’s money to provide property relief. How about taking less of that money in the first place?  Let’s hope Proposition 8 passes.,0

"One point of note with regards to Australia's minimum wage: Tipping is all but unheard of there.  So those working in restaurants or bars might get a higher ""wage"" but little to no tips, so their overall wage is comparable.  Obvious restaurants and bars aren't the only ones that pay low wages, but they are one of the big industries paying lower wages here.  Also prices in Australia are quite a bit higher than in Canada.

"As the Minister of Information and Policy and Strategy advisor to the Hawaiian Kingdom I can state unequivocally and with full authority that the ""aquarium industry"" is in violation of one of the basic principles of Hawaiian culture, malama aina.  Malama aina has been a traditional socio-cultural practice of Hawaiians and ALL Polynesian peoples for many many thousands of years. Malama aina roughly translates as ""nurture and sustain what feeds and provides for us"". It means that we must act ethically, sustainably and on a subsistence basis at ALL times whenever we take food or resources from nature,  To do this we take from nature only what we need to sustain ourselves and NOTHING more and we do nothing that might effect the natural balance of all living things.

This is a country that has corrupted and bullied governances in Asia and Africa to exert their sphere of influence.  It is a regime that has brutally oppressed its' own population since assuming power in 1948.  It is a stain on the 6000 year old civilization of China.  One can only wonder whether this decision is linked to the pay for access scandal and recent contributions to the Trudeau Foundation by those affiliated with the communist regime.

Their only limitation is whether or not they can afford the health care they want. Women don't have that right in many states. Another  right that is not the same for all Americans is the right to own guns under the 2nd Amendment. Our white domestic terrorists are allowed to walk around in public armed while black people are killed for the mere suspicion of being armed. The United States are not that united.

I am speaking here, now, of those who commit suicide, not those who kill from lack of respect for human life. A mother whose child was killed was asked if she could forgive the person who killed her child. She said that judging him was not her burden. That it was God's burden to bear. Someone chose to pull the trigger. They will be responsible for that before God.  But our job is to try to see as God sees, with Mercy rather than judgment. We enter into the mystery of being human.

One is that it is quite possible he did not throw the grenade that killed the American soldier; his wounds when he was found were severe, he was under a pile of rubble and he was unarmed.  The other is that if as a 15 year old he killed someone in a fight in Canada, he would be treated as a young offender and would have served far less time than he has.  At the same time, Dallaire is quite right to point out that he was controlled by a manipulative and abusive father.  It isn't realistic to think that given the environment he was in -- surrounded by Al Queada fighters -- that getting out of the situation was remotely possible. He's never had anything like a fair trial; it is time for those who unload such vitriol at him to stop reacting emotionally and look at the facts of the case.",0

Why are republicans/conservatives and many democrats portrayed as racists when the only mention they make is of illegal immigrants, criminals who have broken our immigration law?

Would the advisor say that because of my age, I would have to have that amount in fixed income; or would it be that I should be diversified around the World; or maybe it would be that I shouldn't be concentrated so much in one sector, such as dividend paying pipelines?  It would certainly be that equities are dangerous, dividends can be reduced by the company and I will lose money.

"Trump's personal life is a matter of PUBLIC record.  Voters knew of his so called ""prevarications"" and still voted for him.

But based on the TED talks I've heard, I suspect he's largely preaching to the choir. Most of these talks really aren't about the gee-whiz aspects of technology so much as how to allow tech to enhance the human experience -- or how to not allow what is essentially human to get overwhelmed by the rapid advances in tech.  Francis isn't saying anything new or radical here, but it's good stuff that's worth reiterating.

"The ""sad"" thing in this ""heartfelt"" piece by the DPEB is that it is the progressive set that rushes to politicize this tragedy- as well as ANY event bad or good- which is perceived to possibly inure to the benefit of Trump.

At this point, that glaring fact may not be necessarily bad. Regardless, the only real progressive grief here is the distraction disappointment from the celebration of the Manafort tidbit- and the hope that blip engenders to over-desperate, willfully corrupt progressives.

What I like about Trump is he was against Mid East wars, and judging by Syria he has followed through on his promise to reduce war in that region. He even got the CIA to stop supporting the 'moderate rebels'  - ie ISIS allies, if not in fact ISIS.   But now that the people he can trust have been removed - with great help from the Charlottesville disaster - I'm expecting renewed push for war in the mid east. The war machine is just too powerful.

Referred to as the second of the two “Reagan tax cuts” (the Kemp-Roth Tax Cut of 1981 being the first), the bill was also officially sponsored by Democrats, Richard Gephardt of Missouri in the House of Representatives and Bill Bradley of New Jersey in the Senate.  The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was given impetus by a detailed tax-simplification proposal from President Reagan’s Treasury Department, and was designed to be tax-revenue neutral because Reagan stated that he would veto any bill that was not. Revenue neutrality was targeted by decreasing individual income tax rates, eliminating $30 billion annually in loopholes, while increasing corporate taxes, capital gains taxes.”",0

He claimed he was only joking!  But, I was shocked that such thoughts still occur, joking or not.  Now, I am sure that comments go both ways as Caucasian people are still referred to as ""h_ _le,"" often with a derogatory adjective, and I've ""corrected"" them as well.

"Our parish makes a big deal about ""fair trade"" Sunday.  A few social justice types take up about 1/3rd of the narthex 2x a month to lay out all sorts of ""fair trade"" coffees, candies, snacks.  And I thought about it.  How is this fair to the mom and pop coffee store 1 block down from our Church?  They have to pay labor costs. They have to pay unemployment insurance/taxes. They have to pay for advertising. They have to pay for utilities, rental space, accountants, etc.  How is the Catholic Church being ""fair"" to the businesses in the neighborhoods?  And more...what the social justice types are doing is to entice all of the overweight Catholics to feed their senses, and giving them the false sense of ""charity"" as they buy and gorge themselves.  How good and fair is all this?  But it's for the 'feeling' of helping that motivates the whole sorry mess.

"Watson made a prudent and proper decision here.  The motion was perfectly legitimate but the real donnybrook is going to be at the top levels of the Judiciary and Executive branches, so it's wise to let it play out there.    The underlying question is whether it's Trump acting unilaterally, or the Supremes fleshing out their ruling, who can decide what constitutes a ""bona fide relationship"" and whether the effective date of the EO can be changed arbitrarily from its original date to a new one six months later.    I don't think there's any doubt who holds the cards.  It's the Court, who issued the ruling and has the authority to clarify it by settling these details at its sole discretion.

"AJ, you are conflating the work of Arthur Laffer with supply side Economics, and misrepresenting one of his main tenets.  Laffer did not advocate lowering taxes as a way to stimulate economic growth as a central principle. He proved empirically and scientificially that there is a level (percentage or proportion) of tax rates beyond which the actual taxes collected will be lower than if the tax rate had been kept at the lower level. In other words, continually raising taxes can be self-defeating.  Under the socialist labour government in Britain in the 1960's the top marginal tax rate was 83%, plus a 15% ""Super tax"" = 98% on unearned income.  98 per frikkin cent!

"There are quite a few mistakes in what was said in the article. For one, the middle 20% of taxpayers are not the middle class - the ""middle class"" comprises as much as 2/3 of the population in countries like Australia. The Economist defines middle class ""as having a reasonable amount of discretionary income, so that they do not live from hand to mouth as the poor do, and defined it as beginning at the point where people have roughly a third of their income left for discretionary spending after paying for basic food and shelter."" This means you can have a country of the ultra rich 1% and 99% poor and no middle class, and the middle 20% of taxpayers are still all poor.  Two, you can cut taxes without cutting them for the rich - you lower the rate in the bottom brackets, benefiting the poor and middle class, and raise the bracket on the rich to compensate. Done.  I do think it's perverse that some people are getting paid by the IRS though, that's one step too far in my book.",0

Indeed, when there were only midwives, abortion was not illegal, regardless of what the Church thought of it, and the Catholic Church had no say in the Federal period.  The 14th Amendment specifies birth or naturalization for citizenship, although born aliens have due process rights as well. In Chapter X, the Court recognized the rights of those who could be born as if they were, with notable exceptions that are very rare. No one just has an abortion because they change their minds about parenthood in the third trimester.  Gonzalez v. Carhart extended jurisdiction to Congress in cases of  partial birth abortion, operating under the Commerce Clause.  It would have been better had they cited the 14th Amendment provisions allowing Congress to enforce the 14th Amendment, which would include expanding personhood to earlier in pregnancy. Note that this case was a stalking horse to repeal Roe.",0

"You clearly don't understand that some companies are legally set up to distribute a larger percentage of cashflow to the shareholder or unit holder rather primarily because they don't require significant capital inputs to generate future revenue.  As a result dividend increases are less frequent or even rare compared to your traditional blue chip dividend stock.  While some of the businesses and sectors come with inherently more risk in exchange for the higher payout, many come with only marginally elevated risk.  The trade off in the later is generally less capital growth.  Many companies that have their origins in the former trust sector are based on this model.

"One of the key policy highlights of the Chrétien governments was the elimination of the deficit and the lowering of the federal debt. Beginning in 1994, the Chrétien government undertook a broad program to reverse federal finances, which included massive spending cuts to federal programs and transfer payments to the provinces and territories (the federal government contributes billions annually to the provinces/territories in support of their social programs, such as public health care). By 1997-98, the federal government recorded its first annual surplus in 28 years, and (as of 2007) has continued to post large surpluses every year. Moreover, the Chrétien government used these annual surpluses to lower the national debt. By 2002-03, the year Chrétien resigned as Prime Minister, the debt had been reduced to $526 billion (Source: Statistics Canada, Federal Finances).",0

"The Whitehouse did not suggest Putin was involved, they stated it as fact. Call a spade a spade. With no direct evidence to present they said he WAS involved. They didn't stop at ""evidence suggests it is likely"", they said he is/was involved, period.  They also said, with nearly equal certainty, that Trump knew, but they provided no direct evidence.   Everything they criticized Trump of, they are now doing; from this story to refusing to acknowledge the winner of the election. The difference: media accounts of Trump generally included a statement, within the first 2 sentences of a story that Trump had no evidence. With this, it comes much later in the stories, if at all.  This is primarily what Trump meant when he said the election was rigged, and post election, the media remains largely ""rigged"" as a dishonest broker of information.",0

"Does it really matter that Singh and Notley are ""at war"" over this specific pipeline project, when they are simply reflecting the deeper political tectonic divides of our time - dirtier resource extraction economics versus cleaner knowledge and service economies, declining rural and small town communities typically based on agriculture and resource extraction versus expanding metropolitan areas based on financial services and high tech, and Alberta as a younger and more aggressive population versus the rest of the Canadian federation, which tends to be older and more traditional in its politics and economic thinking. Compare, for example, Notley who has tried to innovate and experiment, with Horgan who takes very traditional views on BC, or with Singh who is a very traditional cosmopolitan. In this sense, the NDP simply reflects the divides that are emerging, and, as a party, has no coherent vision that will bring people together. But, nor do the other political parties.",0

Many others are falling back mainly on their savings (RRSPs and other) to fund their retirements, are searching desperately for better investment yields and don't have indexed pensions apart from CPP and OAS.

(All rates are based on the Teranet National Bank HPI for Toronto.) One might note that July 2015 would seem to be a more natural marker.

"One thing that I don't see in any press on this subject is the impact of a big minimum wage hike on the cost of child care.  Lots of child care workers earn a lot less than $13/hour.  I think all child care workers are undervalued and should earn far more than they do, but I don't know many families who can afford to pay significantly more for child care. Infant care in a center costs around $1200 a month now.  A big wage hike would push that cost up by hundreds of dollars a month, as the biggest expense most child care centers have is wages.  I think we'll see a lot of mothers pushed out of the labor force by the jump in child care costs.  Combine the loss of an income with generally higher costs for goods and services, and this minimum wage hike will hit middle class families hard.

Near me there's a small country school, just over 100 kids, 8 teachers (plus principal), and almost every one is on fully-paid leave of one kind or another (""stress leave"" being the most popular, and apparently it's contagious) - and even a couple of their replacements are now on fully-paid leave too.  In some cases a classroom of about 16 kids is costing 3 full-time teachers' salaries, plus benefits and pensions, being paid at once.  Now if that's happening all over, no wonder provincial government debt levels are soaring.  But the unions love it, and so does the provincial Liberal government which certainly appreciates the teachers' support every election time.",0
"The leak in the inlet is no big deal--the loss of a potential coal mine is. Fishing doesn't pay our states bills . It doesn't create the jobs oil does. With the decline in the volume of oil going down the pipeline we need more wells. More mines. We need to bring back logging. We need to do more to boost tourism .The gas line doesn't pencil out and hoping pot taxes will save the day doesn't get it done. When one looks at out states history , disasters , both man made and natural , leave Alaska far better off on the other side. The inlet leaks won't do any harm , given all the silt in the water .So it's no big deal or reason to question drilling in the inlet .The Exxon Valdez spill did a hundred times more good than bad. Fishermen were able to double dip using boats for the clean-up AND get checks for the fish the same boat didn't catch. Wrongly , Exxon paid millions more than it should have and we got the free money. The 1964 earthquake modernized us .The EPA throttled will help Alaska.",0

I don't see any difference between how things played out this year and most of the years in the Dan O'Dowd regime. This was basically a post season cup of coffee, when compared to the last and only Rocktober. Any speculation about individual players is just about pointless, until a GM with a track record of shrewdly evaluating and signing talent is obtained. This is largely because the window on the current group of players that have actually performed well is closing and another off season patch job is not going to take them much further than this year. If the owners need guidance to see what it takes to be successful, they don't have to look outside of town. All they need to do is get in their car and drive to the Broncos front office. They would find they consider a run of this many early eliminations as nothing else but a complete embarrassment.",0

"It's been there decades, Doug and no it's not beside any church. It's actually one of three Catholic cemeteries that are still in operation in the area. One of which is right next to a non-demoninational one, they share the same address and entrance but have separate areas for Catholics and non-Catholics and operate independently.  Do they cater exclusively to Catholics? Not exactly but here's what their ByLaws state ""All Catholics and their family members (whether Catholic or not) are invited to make use of our cemeteries"" So unless you have a Catholic connection, you're out. The most recent one opened in 1992 and a quick internet search turned up planning documents for a Catholic cemetery in Halton (near Toronto) as recently as 2010 so there is little doubt that religious based cemeteries are still active and being planed today.

"I agree. I don't see much if any improvement in Siemian...the problem is I don't see much improvement in the line so everything he does is still under pressure. Same line...same Siemain. Goff was considered a bust for awhile. But here is the difference. When Goff was handed the job he kept it and never looked back. He inspired a new coaching staff to dump Kase Keenum and keep him as the starter. Paxton Lynch has not come close to doing anything even close to that. When Siemian was injured and the Broncos played Lynch, he couldn't hold onto the gig and Siemian had to play even when he less than 100%. His 2nd year with a new coaching staff he was again handily beaten out by the incumbent. I think the comparisons to Goff are unwarranted. Goff had a slow start but now is firmly in control. Lynch? He might not even have his job as a second stringer firmly in his grasp. If Siemian doesn't show improvement the Broncos are in trouble because there is nothing on the bench. The Little Guy",0

"Corporations don't lend or not lend on philosophical grounds.  They analyse the risk and lend based on the risk profile and the return on investment.  Desjardins is simply realising that the risk outweighs the return.  You only have to look to the Lac Megentic disaster to understand why.  The railway that caused the problem, was a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary of an American corporation.  This corporate structure was designed to protect the US investors from a disaster such as the one that occurred in Lac Megentic, with the Canadian subsidiary declaring bankruptcy, and the US parent corporation taking the assets and profits back to the US for their shareholders.  In the end, Harper quietly paid $100m Canadian tax dollars to clean the tragedy up.   KM Canada is designed in exactly the same manner, for exactly the same purpose; to protect US investors in the event of a Canadian disaster.  Desjardins appears to believe that a loan to the Canadian KM is high risk.  Stop the KM pipeline.",0

The economy of scale is definitely much lower there - cost of living much lower (housing cost is 1/3 of the city I now live in), opportunities very limited, wages much lower, unemployment is higher too.  It makes no sense for government to impose wage cutoff uniform to the entire province, when these smaller rural economies cannot handle it.  Those small towns operate fine on their own lower-revenue economy.  Everyone is poorer, but the lifestyle is perhaps better due to low cost of living, without the need for government fracking up the economic balance and the business models of wee shops.",0

Point of fact, they were opening a plant in China to serve the Asian market and avoid tariffs. Now, Trump pretends the bailout never happened and that his election is rebuilding the auto industry. Two key traits of an autocrat are detachment from reality and craving mass adulation at any cost. Trump suffers from both. Obama received adulation, he did not seek to create it but his loyalists were blinded by the light and he turned out to be a Jimmy Carter intellectual with little concern or patience for good advice.",0

"Human beings don't do a good job of ""observing"" the universe either. Our senses and our minds are adapted to life at one and only one particular scale, and at only a small range of EM frequencies and sound wave frequencies, and at a very idiosyncratic experience of the passage of time (in spite of the sophistication of some of our highfalutin scientific equations, which in any case are not true ""knowledge,"" nor are they the common property of all human beings). Other kinds of animals are far superior to human beings at observing other aspects of the universe, which must remain quite beyond our comprehension and even our imagining.  As for Plato, inasmuch as he was a child of his time, he gets caught up in a lot of passing interests and suppositions which a Platonist ""after a fashion"" such as myself has no need to commit himself to.

It's insulting that the future mother-in-law doesn't trust him to start. There's trouble in this scenario and the woman has to break away from the purse strings and manipulation of the mother.

The sanctions passed both chambers with plenty of extra votes to overturn a veto.

I'm also curious how congressional Republicans are reacting to Spicer's, Priebus', etc. exit from the WH.

Since zero skill jobs like gas station attendants, bussers at your local restaurants, and graveyard shift inventory stockers at your local grocery store would all have a higher cost of labor - and these employees create no increase in sales, productivity or efficiency just by being paid more - there will be tens of thousands of small businesses who have to raise prices to pay for the higher cost of labor.

The common thread in their comments is Trump is speaking the truth about BLM and Antifa coming to the demonstration equally prepared for a fight.   His supporters ignore the moral difference and buy into the false equivalence between the radical left and right, they see BLM and Antifa as repugnant as the KKK.    He is stating a fact that some parties on both sides were looking for a fight.  For the most part, the media is ignoring that small grain of truth.  Trump supporters position their arguments as a defense of the right to free speech and expression.

Absolutely. The employee contribution as a percentage of earnings (up to the maximum) was 1.8% from 1966 until 1987 when it increased to 1.9%.  From 1988 to 2003 there was a steady increase in the rate up to 4.95%.  The increase was the direct result of dire warnings that CPP would be insolvent within 20 years if the program wasn't changed.  Your employer or the self-employed of course double that contribution for the respective period.  Which is a cost ultimately borne by the employee in foregone pay increases.  Current government policy is to increase the contributions by another full 1% within the next 8 years.    So we have gone from a program that cost employees 3.6% to one that currently costs almost 10% increasing to 12% in the near term.,0
"Yes, the House may choose to ignore the Senate when it voices opposition to a piece of legislation. In practice, sometimes it modifies the legislation and sometimes it doesn't change it at all. However, at the end of the day the Senate must approve the legislation or it cannot become law in Canada.  If the Senate refused to endorse the clear will of the House of Commons, there would be much rumbling about a ""constitutional crisis."" However it wouldn't be a crisis of the written constitution, which assigns equal power in passing law to the Senate. Instead it would be a political crisis, where elected lawmakers express outrage that their unelected peers in the Senate would dare to defy them. The magnitude of that political crisis would depend on a lot of things. In some cases it might not be too big a deal; in others it could be a game changer.

"The question of buying a house depends on the market conditions. One has to consider the difference between rent + utilities and mortgage, utilities, insurances, taxes, and maintenance.  For example, rent: $800, and mortgage: $1200, but with other expenses, total cost: $1900.  Suppose that the house price is $270K, with $55K downpayment, and the price is appreciating at 5% annually.   Suppose stock market is paying 10%, and mortgage interest rate is 3.5%  Over a 5 year outlook: Net Worth with Stock Market = 80,500 + 109,904 = 190,404 - (15% capital gains) = 161K Net Worth with House = $344,596 - 189,816 (remaining mortgage liability)  - Exit Costs (3.5%)= 142K  One of the things that is different with investment calculation today, is the leverage on the mortage.

"With love that the Donald provides who needs hatred?  lol    I am not upset that Hillary lost but I am disgusted that we now have a president who has no idea of what the hell he is doing.

Another economic meltdown similar to what we experienced under the prior republican president?  I also am against wholesale corruption which this president is now giving us.

Obama, despite good intentions, did little to reign in the banks, the corporations, the military or the influence of the wealthy and their lobbyists.  His best effort was reforming the health care system although due to an intransigent congress the benefit was less than it should have been.   Progressives are not attacking the religious; they just don't want them imposing their beliefs on others.  As for gender pronouncement, some issues are valid, others are frivolous non-the-less people should be able to air their views although I would agree that they should not try to deny others from doing the same.   It is never pathetic to act for the common good.  In fact, the reverse is true.",0

"Health care is not a right...It’s a valuable service provided by intelligent, hard-working professionals with years of painstaking education and training, people who, like other Americans, deserve equal protection under the law, people who, like other Americans, have a right to their own life, liberty, property and the pursuit of their own happiness.   Doctors, nurses, hospitals, drug-makers, and health insurers are no more “servants” of the masses, or even of those in need of health care, than are businessmen, bankers, teachers, journalists, or truck drivers servants of those who need their services. If you want to pay for the services of health care providers, then pay them; if you can’t afford it, try to negotiate a discount, or pay by installments, or seek access to private charity; but you have no “right” to take from health care providers what they’re not willing to supply.",0

"No party got 60% of the vote.  None got even 41%.  To say that 60% voted against the Liberals invites the logical conclusion that 61% voted against the NDP and over 80% voted against the Greens.   More people voted against the NDP and Greens than voted against the Liberals.  Nobody voted for an NDP/Green coalition because it wasn't a choice on the ballot, nor did they campaign as such.  In fact, Clark's share of the popular vote exceeded Trudeau's, but nobody is demanding that Trudeau be ousted because 61% of Canadian voters should get their choice of government.    Even of they stay in power, the Liberals will be handcuffed by the virtual tie in seats.  Same for the NDP/Greens.  I doubt another election would produce the same result, although I have no idea who the results might favour.

As early as 2007 mainstream manufacturers such as VW recognized that “all cars eventually will be electric”, but have been slow to act on that important insight.  The reason that all cars will eventually be electric relates to the fact that electric cars are, as a matter of thermodynamic efficiency, at least 500% more efficient than gas cars, have approximately 99% fewer moving parts in the drive train and cost only about 10% as much as a gas car to power.

"A few points to keep in mind: 1. The US private timber owners will never be enthused by large volumes of Canadian lumber flowing into the US when prices are depressed by lack of demand. Things have changed however. The industry in BC is no longer required to cut to protect jobs in order to keep their forest tenures. 2. The pine beetle kill in BC is precipitating a shortage of timber which will eventually cause the closure of more BC mills. 3. Given this shortage BC's forest industry is buying mills in the US. Margins are much higher there and output from these southern mills is providing over 20% of the lumber in the US market. 4. The new President of the US is not politically beholden to the US lumber lobby and will probably make a decision based on the effect import duties would have on home construction prices. It is possible, though, that he will open federal lands to logging that have heretofore been closed to that activity to increase domestic timber supply.",0

Four recent financial conflagrations are covered, with the inclusion of happy-talk columns before each, befuddled items during the panics, and post-panic articles that show we have not learned very much from them.    Of course the final section is about the housing bubble (boosted by Greenspan) that investment banks are still totally responsible for, and for which they have not been sufficiently punished.  Return of Glass-Steagall would bar investment banks from f**king over consumers, and would make consumer banking the dull business it should be.  No chance of that.

Regarding loving one's neighbor, however, again I fear you promote a tepid and materialistic perspective of Christian teachings.  The Bible says ""God is with us.""  Materialists think it means, ""God is on our side"" (as we fix the world).   It really means, ""God is present.""        Jesus was very clear that his kingdom is not of this world until he makes it so.  Christianity is for us, for our inner peace, guidance and direct experience of spirituality.  Through this inner connection we will know the best actions to take when we need to take them - read Paul again.     Christianity isn't so Christians can ""fix"" the rest of the world through political organizing, even though that's what a lot of Christians believe. If we truly want to love our enemies, we have to be willing to let the world go exactly as he did.",0

"First of all, no company likes to lose orders, no matter the size.  Second, I think you fail to see that this is far more than money, this is about relationships and branding. Canadian is known worldwide, to be America's closest partner, so the world is watching our business relations closely to learn what to expect in their own relations.  In playing along with Washington's current protectionist attitude towards trade, Boeing has shown the world (esp. NATO members) that they may not be the best partner for future procurement projects and that they may be moving more of their production home (America first) in the near future. As such, they could have seriously damaged their brand and their global bottom line long term.

This does not mean they don't have rules by which they govern that they hold to under most circumstances, but that -- for whatever reason -- they don't see a reason to write them down in a single document. They spread their governance rules out through acts of Parliament, etc.  Don't get me wrong. I think constitutions are a good thing, but it's really not a good argument against Israel, that they don't have a single written constitution. They have a operative one based on their Declaration of Establishment.  Just how closely does the US Constitution and the government that has grown from it reflect the Founding principles of our nation? I would argue that our Constitution has been used to subvert natural rights and has become a violation of the Declaration of Independence. Compare them and see what I mean.",0

For the most part I agree with Bob. I'll go one step further and add that an income tax should be considered only after the permanent fund dividend is stopped. Taxing income earners in order to pay a dividend is an abusive form of socialism. The permanent fund should be used to subsidize the state and pay welfare to the portion of the state that lives in poverty. Paying a dividend to people who don't need it while taxing their income is perverse.,0

Also remember 'The Battle of Britain' and 'Dam Busters' portraying actions in which Americans had no part. 'Sink The Bismarck' and 'Battle of the River Plate' comes to mind as well. When it comes to other battlefields, such as the Pacific, however, Americans were the main players and deserved top billing (indeed, Canada's deployment to Hong Kong was one of the most costly missteps in that campaign). I also thought that 'Saving Private Ryan' was the best war movie I'd ever seen. It depicted the horrors of combat in a way that would expunge the notion of glory from any sane person's mind.

China's economy is such that any nation engaging in international trade as a significant part of their economic structure must deal with China.

St.Paul admonished us to examine ourselves -- not each other -- lest we eat and drink unworthily.  The church forms consciences by reflecting on Scripture, Tradition and the lived experience of the church, but goes beyond its biblical mandate when attempting to impose a ""one-size fits all"" discipline.  Whether an individual person or couple is in a ""sinful relationship"" is a judgment made between them, their confessor and their God.

"This is almost identical to an argument I put out over a decade ago.    I pointed out to my Democratic friends that  lax enforcement hurt labor and benefited ownership,   Illegal immigration increased the profitability of ownership and has a negative effect of wage pressure that just increases the disparity between ownership and wage earners.  That used to be a Democratic pillar in the private sector before public employee's became the focus.  If either party is serious about regulating foreign workers, then you punish employers who hire those with no documentation.  A wall doesn't touch the  50% of workers who enter the country legally and overstay visa's.  I'm a liberal who fully supports well regulated immigration.

That unfortunately is true. What that means is that there needs to be a culture shift not only in the way the Churches handle sex abuse(I include my Anglican Church because we aren't immune to this either). There has to be a shift in the culture of the criminal justice systems globally.   Things like the statue of limitations that is used to protect offenders has to go. People think that Bernard Law got away with what he did because of the Church. That's not the whole story. The statue of limitations in Boston and Massachusetts is what made prosecution impossible.   I'm very big on emphasizing this because so much energy is focused on accountability in the Church(understandable) that not nearly enough leg work and energy is focused on the court system itself where the real power for holding people accountable actually lies. Because the most the Church can do in accountability is report it to the authorities and remove priests.,0

"I think the true problem faced by feminism is the fact that egalitarianism is the only true moral approach to making the world a better place for all to live in.  As the principles of gender egalitarianism increasingly become normalized and mainstream in Western civilization, the feminist movement must take on increasingly radicalized positions to garner the attention they so desire about their perceived grievances.  As such, feminism's professed belief in gender equality increasingly rings hollow as time passes, leading men and women who believe in the principal of equality, to reject the modern iteration of the feminist movement.  That is why I feel morally obliged to declare myself an egalitarian while rejecting modern feminism wholesale.",0

Connecting to desirable destinations and minimizing the number of transfers to other modes (like the bus) is critical to the success of any transit system.  Without a connection to Waikiki, the line is already not taking advantage of a huge pool of potential riders including visitors.  Ala Moana Center is the next best terminus as long as a frequent shuttle provides a convenient connection to Waikiki.  If the line is to be shortened to save money (which is a completely rational thought), then it must still extend to downtown Honolulu to serve the employment base and land use density that is required to make rail transit cost-effective.  Any additional taxes beyond a 10-year extension should come from hotel-resort taxes only to truly make it visitor funded.",0

The 2000 times energy figure is garbage!  Peter H. Gleick and Heather Cooley who published those figures back in 2009 left out most of the energy costs associated with tap water.  All they included in their study were the physical treatment at the municipal water treatment plant and original cost to put in place the distribution system.  They never factored in the energy costs associated with the chemicals used in the treatment of tap water. They failed to factor in energy costs associated with wastewater treatment. And they left out the energy costs associated with continued maintenance of tap water infrastructure.  Once you include all those missing energy figures the actual difference in energy usage drops down below 100 times. Which puts water bottle energy usage along the same lines as fruits and vegetables we buy at grocery stores.,0

A Conservative Government, reliant on the Northern Ireland DUP, will be more reactionary and intransigent on domestic social issues and EU negotiations.

Pope Francis inherited as Prefect Cardinal Mueller, who has a pastoral side, but leans heavily toward the juridical-canonical work of the Congregation. By appointing Cardinal O'Malley, Pope Francis adds a pastoral voice that echoes throughout many parts of the Catholic world. In this sense, he appears to be sending a signal that he wants CDF to be more pastoral and that, if necessary, he will replace Mueller. Some commentators in Rome believe O'Malley is Francis' choice to succeed him, in which case a position in CDF would help make his case in a future conclave.",0

In response, a federal agency sent an agent half way around the world pretending to be a broker who would sell the parts to the dude if he came to the US to pick them up.  The dude does not see an obvious problem with this at worst assuming that export restrictions are just minor infractions as most people think about such things.  He comes to the US and is arrested and will now face years in US jails.  Meanwhile, his family and employees suffer.

Collective-action and economy-of-scale problems make it unlikely consumers can get improvement, even if they offer to pay more.

Pens rarely had anyone in the slot and their wonderful short  passing game was no where to be seen. Sens hustled and easily earned this one, Pens hardly moved other than skate in circles along the boards and took easy shots from the blueline that Anderson saw like first baseman, all night.  If they don't find their team hustle, this one could be over early.  Let's hear it for: no Canadian team is going to make it past the first round. Pens, I believe are  the defending champs, No?",0

"There are probably a lot of factors in play here; a few of the biggest that I recall from looking into this a while back:   1) EWEB has huge capital costs associated with its hydro dams (Carmen-Smith, Leaburg--Walterville), while SUB buys all of its juice from BPA, so no fixed capital costs to cover; 2) EWEB has a progressive rate structure that encourages conservation and imposes a surcharge on residential customers using over 800kWh/month (SUB has a tiny surcharge that starts at 1,500 kWh/month during the heating season). This can be a real hit for folks that use electric heat during winter and have poor insulation. 3) EWEB has a much bigger distribution network than SUB with higher maintenance costs, hence the higher delivery charge as part of their electric rates.  I wish someone from EWEB would provide a more accurate/ up-to-date information on this; it's been a while since I looked into this issue.",0

"Re:  The religious right starts to look past Election Day.   “If [Trump] loses, I think there will be a huge identity crisis in the Republican Party, and it is really hard to sort out,” Bauer says. “If you turn off values voters and working class America, you will have a party that is made up of a group of donors and a group of commentators. That won’t go far without actual voters.”  Two points.  I think if Trump wins there will be or should be a huge identity crisis in the Republican Party.  They will be a doomed party, alienating women, Hispanics, African Americans and not supported by Asian Americans, or millenials on issues like gay marriage, or the college educated.  It isn't going to work to be a party of old white men.  Second point.  We are all ""values voters.""

Maybe we start by changing them to the ""Long-Term (More than 30 days)"" rates - $78/day total (cuts $1.5m off). Then eliminate the ""travel during session"" category - they're in Juneau to work, not travel. Lots of whining about ""not enough time"" - being there for 120 straight days will help with that.  Also need to remember that the state doesn't *owe* Juneau a government-funded economy. It's absolutely retarded to have our government working in an isolated vacuum like that. I'd love to attend hearings, but how? I can't afford to take 120 days off work and go sit in a hotel in Juneau and wait to see when things happen. If Anchorage (or Palmer/Wasilla/etc) can host the legislature significantly cheaper than Juneau, then let Juneau counter-bid to keep them there. Maybe the 32k population of Juneau can donate their PFDs to the state to help offset the expense.",0

The city if Cape Town keeps losing court cases over eviction and housing. Yet rarely appeals. If 'just a high court judge' was so wrong why do they hardly ever appeal? Surely they would then think the appeals court or concourt would side with them? Yet they do not usually appeal. Because their approach is to evict unconstitutionally and challenge it in court using a trial to buy time. Once they lose they do what they should have done in the first place. But only for those who can afford a court challenge and 6 months to a year later.  If government can game the system then why shouldn't citizens?",0

To say that Castros' legacy is anything but a betrayal of the Cuban peoples is an insult to basic human rights and freedoms expected by Canadians and of their representatives abroad.   By not condemming (in the most vigorous way) 50 years of mass political imprisonment, torture, political executions; the crushing of free speech, free assembly, free press, and by not condemming the ensuing impoverishment, food and housing shortages; one can only conclude that the distinguished Entwistle is a fool, a closet Marxist, or has ulterior motives.

If they were RIGHT they would appeal so the concourt can, eventually, find in their favour and they can stop getting sued three times a year. They don't appeal because they know they'll lose and if that happens, there won't BE another case -the next magistrate will give summary judgement against them if there's a standing con-court decision.

"The bottom line is that your vehicle is worth less after a claim.   Not the full amount but less than before.   This loss of value isn't covered.

If not, then you have to keep trying, or drop your price.

These (syrian) migrants, were flown into Canada (on our tax dollars), by Air Canada, and Armed Forces air craft, when these politicians know very well that Canada has high unemployment, and these newcomers would not find work! There are many jobs (going begging!) in Alberta and Saskatchewan (mostly retail and hospitality), and settling them in these provinces would help alleviate the labour shortage! But these people know very well that...""why work"", when they can get generous welfare benefits, free accommodation, free education, etc.! Go walk in downtown Toronto, where the city is bursting with a large increasing population, empty factories, low vacancy rates and very high rents! These people did not wish to emigrate to Turkey, Iran nor Saudi Arabia, as these countries didn't want them, so why should Canada (aka, we the dumb taxpayer), take them here?",0

Let's assume that everybody, top to bottom jumped ""all in"" on what this article recommended immediately after last week's Sarin attack, and there was no military response to Assad.  What confidence level would you put on this approach's ability to prevent another Sarin attack this week, or next, or in May?   If what we've been told that this military response took out about 20% of Syria's jets is true, how different are those odds in this same period now?  Which of these two plans will likely have the lower count of ""collateral damage?""  And let's assume that just to make a point, Assad tries anther tomorrow, and the next military takes out, say this time, 40% of Asads jets?  Again, compare the short term likely collateral damage between these scenarios.  I am all for peace.  But until the peacemakers can become effective, sadly, I think we need to keep, and occasionally use, military responses.",0

Basically the sales job amounted to you will get all these things and someone else will pay for them.

And yes there are plenty of Canadian tech workers who would probably meet 80% of Mr. Alaire's hiring criteria but they would also have to fork out more cash like you would do in a normal economy - i.e. where supply and demand of resources is not inelastic!  So you have people like Mr. Alaire and others blurting out their sob story where they can't find tech talent. 20 years ago when we didn't have so much immigration, you met maybe 70% of the hiring criteria and the rest you learned.  After the decades of massive immigration we now have corporations addicted to cheap foreign labour at the xpense of Canadians.

"Got another manager here taking out his starter for no good reason.  Rich Hill was humming along, did give up a solo shot, but otherwise was on his game.  Down 1-0 bottom of the 5th, runner on 2nd, no out, pitcher due up, Roberts pinch-hits, batter naturally pops up, doesn't advance the runner even, and the end result of the move by the manager was to lose his very effective starter.  Now, Roberts can make these highly-questionable moves as his bullpen is very good--as good as his starter in this game, if you get to where I've drifting....  Girardi went this route in game 2 vs Cle, though his team was way up in the game, so the pitching change made even less sense.  That move blew up in his face and shoulda cost his team the series and Girardi his job, but Cle managed to blow the series and save NYY manager from himself.  LAD are so strong that it probably doesn't matter what foolhardy moves Roberts makes, his team will prevail.  But the ends don't always justify the means.....",0

The President and Min of Defence and Police must specify where such deployments will occur plus other requirements of the Defence Act. The SANDF may so deploy to the Cape Flats area but will do so based on an SAPS generated plan of operation with  CJOps operational inputs in respect of troop levels and possible tasks.

Before making a definitive change concerning abortion and absolution Church authorities need to examine these questions carefully.   --A woman can't conceive on her own--the man is equally responsible, but men don't face directly the responsibility of pregnancy and raising a child alone; men can walk away.  Why does the condemnation of abortion fall solely on women? --Study in detail the process from conception to birth.  Conception usually takes place in the fallopian tubes.  Then the fertilized egg must reach the uterus and implant there.  But from 30-50% of fertilized eggs don't implant.  And an estimated 10% of confirmed pregnancies are lost to miscarriage.

I could go on and on.   Is the Church in a better place today than in 1962?  I don't think so.

Coming to Hawaii from the east coast (with its top ranked private and public schools), it puzzled me as to why people are so defined by where they went to high school rather than college, job, etc.  Punahou absolutely provided a first class education and is a truly wonderful school (and rightfully ranked as one of the very best in the nation), but there is something bizarre about how local people think and speak about it, as well as pursue it.  It is not a place for the best and brightest to aspire to, but rather a desperate requirement to attend Punahou or Iolani in order to actually BE the best and brightest.  The pathetic condition of most public schools and DOE in Hawaii (which we tried prior to private schooling) is to blame for much of this desperation.  The quality chasm is so huge between public and private education that this is where any discussion must begin - with the public schools.",0

Catholics believe there are extremely solid reasons for believing that life begins at conception. They are not amenable to believing otherwise. They understand why others are in error, why others don't believe as they do, but that's as far as it goes. Believing as they do, each abortion is the taking of innocent life, a heartbreaking thing which, if done with full knowledge of the wrongness, would justify the harshest condemnation. It's to Catholics' credit that they fight for unborn life, and yet give the benefit of the doubt to abortionists by telling themselves, ""They know not what they do."" But the real moral fiber of some abortionists is on display with late term partial birth abortion, where no serious person can doubt that the baby in the womb is as human as a day-old infant. Abortion at that stage is clear murder, but Pelosi, Clinton, and Obama would assert the right to do it.",0

I believe that there are valves designed to shut the flow off slowly, in case of a leak, as to not create a water hammer effect. If those valves were to be shut off quickly, the pipeline could burst somewhere upstream of each valve. Are the people operating TAPS cognizant of the potential danger? Even if TAPS isn't hard-wired into the N. American fiber-optic system, there are still the satellite connections. And if the NSA attack tools have already infected TAPS, they could be set to trigger as soon as any remotely activated controls are taken off-line. Were I in charge, I would immediately have all shut-off valves physically blocked from activating, except by manual override. That alone would prevent the worst of damage.

Public schools aren't getting our students there.  We should improve courses, and bring back vocational type classes such as shop to give students wider diversity in their education, and also let them find that maybe they want to pursue vocational learning as opposed to college learning.",0

"Re: the headline.  Of course it isn't.  TV viewers wouldn't sit still for Archie's original language or issues-(Archie's first comic appeared about the time Japan hit Pearl Harbour.  Characters and situations constantly changed.) So, this series just hitch-hikes (I won't say ""hijacks"") something we THINK we are familiar with it--and re-imagines it for today.    In doing that, it projects today's speech-patterns, issues,  body language and values onto those of another age. Producers and writers MUST do this in order to make it palatable for 21st century audiences.  Always have. Did you think Roman gladiators REALLY talked like Russell Crowe in that movie?  So, amused, yesterday, when I read that Trump's Tweets emulated FDR's ""informal"" fireside chats.  Informal?  Read a couple--they're on-line!  FDR didn't use the language of the ""common people.""

"@Roy Kamisato:  That's not true.  Especially about the part on driverless cars.  That particular solution wasn't even discussed 4 years ago because the technology was only in a concept stage back then.  It was also never brought up by any of the major candidates.  Nobody from PRP or the current Mayor's campaign or even the Cayetano campaign brought any of these alternatives that could have been implemented instead of building the rail system.  If you can prove otherwise, show me the statements from the campaigns that stated these alternatives to the masses.  You seem to have this bias that rail is the only solution to our problems and so we should build it regardless of the cost.  My point in the three posts above is we didn't have to spend all this money, but Mufi, Caldwell, and others decided to go with this wasteful option that benefits their union friends and private companies now involved in building the rail.",0
"A quote from your article Joan - ""For instance, no major news media devoted time during this electoral cycle to teaching the American public the advantages or disadvantages of any single political promise.""  I'm surprised at your naivete Joan in stating that no major news media devoted time to teaching.... the major news media is corporate owned and specialists in fake news.  Your election times are a circus for the world to behold and many many people in your country woke up to the fact that your 'major news media' did not do its job precisely because it is fake news.  It doesnt matter what corrupt puppet your voters want, it is a farce giving you all the illusion you have control.  (Don't worry - very similar in our country).

"I start with the ideal that all children who are conceived should have the blessing of being born to a married mom and dad.  Anything beyond that ideal falls into the ""safety net"" category; that is, we should not normalize children being born out of wedlock and creating an entitlement for the mom and child, since that only promotes more of the same.  A woman getting pregnant out of wedlock was once considered a terrible situation; today, political correctness and cultural propaganda force us to accept it as something to be embraced.  Baloney.  Orphanages and adoption are the way to deal with unwanted children; not killing them as fetuses and not taxpayer funding to moms who don't want them or can't afford them.  Over 70% of children in Blacks (and nearly 50% of all kids in the US) are born out of wedlock; dare I guess how many of those receive public assistance?  Sex.  Produces. Children.  Act accordingly.",0

I have been suffering from tmj and fibromyalgia for 35 years.  I was injured at work at the age of 18 and have not had one pain free day since. Imagine for a moment if you can. I have seen the same doctor for 35 years as well as use only one pharmacy. My dosage has never exceeded 40mg per day which provided me with enough relief to have a limited quality of life. Due to the pressure this has brought upon our doctors and patients and the lack of support from anyone my doctor has decided to retire from private practice September 1st. It's hard to express how overwhelmed and anxious I am to be suddenly in such a position and worry what this means for me.  I would like to see the number of overdoses that were due to patients suffering with such unmanageable pain that were turned away from receiving responsible care from a responsible prescribing doctor.

These issues predate still exist today as a general matter. But the specific issues with unmasking of Trump communications picked up when non-citizens were being monitored is not covered except to say we should be sure those names were protected. In an interview on March 19, Nunez said the documents leaked by the two Whitehouse employees at the National Security Counsel and any other information Nunez saw did not contain any evidence of illegal unmasking or any FISA warrants for Trump. He did say he wanted Congress to take a look at the procedures involving unmasking to be sure they are as protective of privacy as they should be.",0

Maintaining the current minimum wage means that homelessness will increase, as there are homeless families whose adult members are working, but are not making enough to pay rent.

It is not necessarily unreasonable that rich people will get tax cuts and lower-middle-class people will lose tax credits either. This simply reverses the changes that Obamacare did. Obamacare imposed taxes on rich people to pay for subsidies for lower-middle-income people.  Of the people who will ""lose"" health insurance, many will be younger people who simply don't want to pay for it; if they get sick, they will get it then, because pre-existing conditions still will not be disqualifying.

"The problem is they loan money for homes, then turn around and buy stocks, bonds and that money perpetuates a huge cash reserve for them.   If you go to there websites you have to check out their financial reports. They have done amazingly well making a bunch of money. They paid the state a measly 10 million dollar dividend on nearly 500 million in cash.    As far as home loan assistance for those who need it, that's not a bad idea. But they also loan to folks who qualify at private banks.  On the other hand private business can go to a private bank with their pro forma and ask for a loan, not a state government quasi entity. We cannot afford this anymore. I'm not sure what the Director's make, but it's probably a lot more than Walker as they are outside that wage control.  These two programs are dinosaurs started in the 80's and need to be restructured so the state derives a much better return.  They operate like banks.

California is becoming ground zero for resisting Trump's environment destroying executive orders, the courts are stymieing Trump's Muslim bans and Republicans have outed him as in ineffectual negotiator and called his bluff on empty threats to hold a vote on Trumpcare. Trump golfs more than Obama did, after criticizing Obama for it. He still refuses to release his taxes, after mocking Romney for delaying release of his during the 2012 race.

"Good Point - if the United States could send tens of thousands of men and women abroad to fight evil terrorists, spend trillions of dollars in its efforts and violate the privacy and civil liberties of hundreds of millions of Americans after 9/11, the United States can confront the evil threat from gun violence within America. In fact, it would be much easier because there are actual solutions to the problem - restrict the population from purchasing and possessing semi-automatic and automatic firearms. The only purpose of these weapons (and armor piercing ammunition) is to kill other human beings. And let's not forget, hunting is now a sport. People can go to the supermarket to get food. Hunters certainly don't need a semi-automatic weapon to hunt some deer. Worried about a 'threat' from your own government? Don't elect tyrants. It's pretty simple.

If Trump loses, the Bannon/Trump machine will wreak as much havoc on the government and people of the United States as they can.

The fact that, that's all it took, leads me to believe that there is a false sense of confidence permeating within the Broncos organization. The consequences of which are more than just a Broncos loss. Siemian got rattled. He showed his age. He needs rehabilitation. The game planning brain trust looks baffled. Dink & dunk and then running the ball failed last year as it is failing this year. The offensive line is playing frustrated.

Processes get changed, but the bottom line is clear and present. If you have $100 to deliver something and that used to pay for 10 people an hour, the $100 does not change but the  amount of people do. If you can now only  provide 6.5 people then you must find a way to make up for that difference.

"Nicely written article that took the time to give readers specific examples of gross generalizations, something I did not do yesterday.  I was thinking that his background in philosophy fits his very fuzzy writing on modern politics.  Yet I know just enough about philosophy to know that the discipline is working closely with modern physics which changes many things in philosophical dialog.   Yes, philosophers do not deny scientific evidence and in fact philosophy supports the sciences method of discovery.  The good professor made no attempt to back his claims with facts.  I did not want to insult all philosophy professors.     My assumption is that the endorsement was from an academic and any academic would do.   But the writing  is pure politics, a recitation of the modern talking points of the new populist conservatism.",0

Another good column by Charles Wohlforth. The incredibly high cost of health care is a huge drag on the Alaskan economy and nobody seems interested in addressing it. The only way you can bring down health costs in our current system is with bargaining power to pressure providers to accept lower costs; insurance groups in the lower 48 do it all the time. The ideal solution of course is a single payer plan which has the power to keep costs down and also gives patients complete freedom in choosing their provider. Alaska could make a step in this direction if all the government plans (covering roughly 30% of Alaskans) were combined into a single plan and then businesses and individuals were also allowed to purchase into that plan. That could produced a large enough patient group to exert bargaining power and to spread the risk over more customers.,0

Some corners following a meandering tide line drawn by nature that make a mockery of the linear mythology of an exact 200 foot measurement.  The actual meander as authenticated by expensive tideland US recorded BLM surveys which it is illegal to obliterate.  So, ARRC owns to the point where the soil is tidally affected and gets wet.

There were once several refineries here, but they left to WA state to process Alaska oil. Only Chevron remained, but KM wouldn't commit to continue supplying Chevron with oil. So oil by rail for Chevron has been travelling through populated White Rock, Crescent Beach  and New Westminster.   Very risky !!!  KM should be continuing to commit a supply to Chevron, but KM was just for maximum profit, regardless of the risks to the GVRD.  I'm not surprised Chevron sold their refinery.  So this pipeline is mainly to profit KM, regardless of it's poor location.  I would expect this very poor oil route to increase the amount of oil shipped over many years, by increasing it's capacity.  I didn't vote for the NDP or Green parties, but I support their plan to stop the pipeline expansion as a better alternative.  I feel all shipping of oil on those routes should be stopped.",0

His behavior befitted a prepubescent bully not a serious potential executive.

At that time Albert the Great, Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure [three saints] were teaching.  Oh, yes, I have studied the writings of both Aquinas and Bonaventure.

I saw some of them at my kids' high school. Most of the award winners were not white and over half were young woman.. It speaks to the success of programs and resources to help girls and minorities succeed. We assumes that the white boys are okay and don't need any support. Are they? Some are, some are defiantly not. It is surprisingly easy to identify the white boys who need some support and intervention in high school, you can see them crying out for help while they are causing a problem in a fast food restaurant.  Perhaps early intervention to help them find a path forward would be helpful. Just calling them misogynists and racists is probably not the solution. They need the care and guidance that they are not receiving at home, as do all youth regardless of background. Love not jail.",0

"WOW! All one has to do to find this letter factual and agree with it is to completely ignore history .Take your misguided thinking on Reagan for example..we know for sure that we experience no gain in long-term tax revenue from increasing tax rates on those making more than $200,000 per year. Lower tax rates, particularly on labor and capital, lead to higher levels of employment and economic growth.   The Reagan tax cuts reduced rates for all income classes, especially the low and middle income earner. Reducing the high marginal rates (up to 70% on high-income earners) causes little, if any, revenue loss, because of the large, positive supply-side effects.  by the time President Reagan left office, the economy was generating more tax revenue at a maximum 28% rate than many on the left forecast it to generate at a maximum 70% rate. The Reagan tax-rate reductions did, in fact, pay for themselves — but it took about seven years.",0
"The UO has continued to slide in its academic reputation, and this revelation that Gottfredson received more than a million dollars in severance pay, makes the UO administration and the Board of Trustees look like unqualified  amateurs who certainly shouldn't be in charge of leading and running a flagship state university.  By the way, no university president at a public or private university and regardless of prestige deserves to be paid anywhere close to a million dollars in compensation.  The UO became a national laughingstock a few years ago with the NY Times report about the new athletic facility, and this revelation about Gottfredson's severance only adds to that infamy. The new UO president, Schill, really needs to clean house. The UO really needs to refocus on the core mission of any flagship state university -- teaching, research, and public service for the state's population.",0

Chances are that many migrants, whether genuine refugees or those on the move for economic reasons, will feel highly encouraged to make their way to Canada fairly soon following Trudeau's warm words of encouragement: not good. It does appear as though many migrants from developing countries first travel to Latin America in order to proceed up to the US (where Trump has now made things a bit harder) and then to Canada. Those bland Canadian border guard shifts may soon be a thing of the past, they had better get ready for the impending stampede, and order plenty of flowers for the numerous welcoming ceremonies, Germany-style.",0

The Kawananakoa lineal claims today are further degraded by this Kalakaua attachment.  Very many Hawaiians looked upon Kamehameha as a usurping low level alii, and never abdicated to him.  Descendants of those Hawaiians exist today, and consequenty, never abdicated to Liliuokalani or the U.S. as well.  Personally otherwise, all humans are damaged goods, especially priests, queens and kings.

It seems like most of the world outside of Denver forgets that last year was ONLY Trevor's 2nd season, his 1st as a starter, our O-line & run game were horrific, & he only played 3 & 1/2 games even REMOTELY healthy.  Even MORE baffling though, are the critiques about his arm strength & athleticism. He's not packing ELWAY'S cannon, but he can make EVERY throw that an NFL QB needs to make. And in those 1st 3 games where he WAS healthy, there were a NUMBER of times on 3rd & mid-yardage downs that no one would get open down field, & he'd take off around the end & get JUST enough for the 1st down, & keep the drive alive.",0

"Since the 19th century, those who were currently citizens of Canada--but whose families had emigrated here--have been afraid of new immigrants, for much the same reasons. In the mid 19th century there was a pecking order of which immigrants were the most desirable, beginning with British and Americans only. In the late 19th century, British and Americans were preferred, followed by northern and western Europeans, central and eastern Europeans and then by Jews and southern Europeans. Religious sects such as Hutterites and Mennonites or Doukhobors were less wanted and Asians and Blacks were almost unacceptable. People displaced by WWII were seen as dirty DP's who were bringing crime to Canada. The truth of the matter is that the majority of immigrants became great citizens of Canada despite the fears of the ""old stock"" Canadians. When will the ignorance and misinformation stop? There should be a place in Canada for people seeking refuge and a new life despite the ranting of the ignorant.",0

EXAMPLE:  If a buyer, working for a large company, on their off hours advertised their position and role within that company and solicited to their vendors/potential suppliers that they could pay $100 to attend a fundraising event, which they will be attending, for their children's sports team, that person would be called in to the office Monday morning and would leave that office with a box full of their personal possessions.

Why fund the CBC if all it can do is mimic its private competitors? Which is pretty much what it has done (and then not all that well) for the past 20 years or more. The fact a succession of prime ministers including and particularly Harper drastically cut the CBC's budget helps explain but does nothing to justify its failing performance.
