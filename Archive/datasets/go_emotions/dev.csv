Happy Cake Day [NAME]! Use what talents you possess: the woods would be very silent if no birds sang there except those that sang best.,1
"That's fine. I'm searching for the truth, not just the legal truth. To each their own.",1
"I actually realize this today. Woke up, swept the floor and the bathroom, have being amazing all day long.",1
"Well it depends on your level, class, and how good you roll.",1
This is the guy to talk to! Draftbuffs amazing and getting better constantly.,1
Remember they are an ex for a reason. Seeing that smile probably made you remember all the happy times,1
You will not have damage to extremities when applied in a temporary situation as in this case. Simple as that.,1
This is the truest statement I’ve ever read about [NAME]. May he smile mercifully upon you.,1
is a minimum score. If you don't get it you fail the ASVAB. It's a really simple concept.,1
Go on Webtoons and look up Boo! It's sex. Great freaking sex ed comic.,1
starting a new trend lol,1
The ones who agree with her are the only ones who actually address *her* issue....which is how to deal with boundary stomping relatives.,1
I like this idea.,1
"I think it's hilarious you guys think this will ""help"" [NAME] Yeah [NAME] was bad, but [NAME] didn't show very much either",1

Hope you get “at are it again”,1
It's the end of the world as we know it...and I feel fine,1
Congratulations on the job interview! NParents seem to give the absolute *worst* job advice. I'm glad that you've figured that out earlier than I did!,1
Pretty sure it’s a reference to Netflix’s “Bird Box” movie. In which case - brutal; I love it.,1
Im actually going to this game! One of the only chances every year I have to see the boys play in person. LET GO DEVILS,1

Well I mean Australia is a good example of this working isn’t it ?,1
"I love how the dog bites hard enough to pull it away, but soft enough to not kill it",1
I like you. No promo,1

Now I hate the giants as much as the next but they're 4th in average attendance and percentage.,0
No way dude. The Wilpons’ are so cheap that the Twitter guy is also the contract guy. (Was that a good Twitter impression?),0
