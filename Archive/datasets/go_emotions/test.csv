Boner. I'd have the weirdest boner.,0
It's also not worth the costs because most of the time people are being petty don't actually have a claim to make.,0
"What was the ""injustice?"" Nothing happened to him. Assuming his story was not hugely exaggerated to fit the victim card.",0
That is insanity,0
they will also hate the eagles for years to come because their fans were a bunch of meanies,0
Yeah he's a cunt but that doesn't mean he should be prosecuted for a joke. No matter how bad taste it was.,0
I know they don‚Äôt want it. I just wish they did.,0
Oh sure. I bet [NAME] is sick. Sick of Skyward Sword.,0
Is it weird if I said I forgot how brutal things could get? Like what happened to [NAME] oh my-I was appalled.,0
"Bro, he left his team in the middle of the game... idc what argument you have with [NAME] you still left your team.",0
That partially explains why season 4 was such a fucking mess,0

I am still missing money from a August 2018 withdrawal with no update and no success. Quadriga - give me back my money!,0
Except forming an opinion of a topic without even having basic knowledge of said topic makes you sound pretty arrogant and entirely undercuts your opinion.,0
Worried me there,0
That's a really cheap cop-out for rather common criticism of those games.,0
It‚Äôs not even news.,0
Refusing to pay someone for work that they've done is theft. You can try to justify it any way you want but that's what it is.,0
Help me [NAME] I'm bully in high school for no reason.,0

"Tranlated: Wooooo be afraid of the spooky ""shadowban"" so don't do the thing that gets your message to a wider audience. Smh",0
I honestly miss [NAME],0
Watching [NAME] flip his head back every poke of contact is possibly the most frustrating thing to watch,0
That was my mistake. It should only show your First Name and The 1st letter of my last name.,0
Hasn‚Äôt hurt me none,0
"Honestly, if you did not, then you were watching the video incorrectly.",0
Chi snowing. Can't get a break.... Also I'm crushing it.,0

Huge office fan and I agree. [NAME] and [NAME] are annoying.,0
Fuck [NAME] pai,0
I literally got the same bug,0
That‚Äôs an insult!! To fecal matter.,0
Any rap song because I hate it,0
Before the trade happened I knew [NAME] was [NAME] but [NAME] beauty had not reached me yet,0
That‚Äôs horrible. What country? If you don‚Äôt mind. My [NAME] was abused by her heavily religious (Pentecostal) father.,0
Reacting to [NAME] at this point just makes me feel worse about the artist.,0
> punishment for saying no to rape Surely if you wanted to rape someone you'd have to punish them for saying yes...,0
"[NAME] gets a lot of unfair criticism. [NAME], too",0
What the hell was that,0
You are fucking retarded,0
Filthy birdbrain-loving scum barely deserve the bullets needed to boot them off the mountain. Moreiya 4 life,0
Super unflattering. [NAME] is not overweight but this ensemble made her appear chunky.,0
Your manager sounds like an idiot. Not saying he/she is. Just sounds like it from this.,0
"My adopted daughter told me, ""You can't tell me what to do. You're not my dad."" While true, it still stung.",0
I‚Äôm so sorry the internet has inconvenienced you,0
No. It‚Äôs slower and takes more calculation but it can be done. That‚Äôs why it should be practiced.,0
Please dont put words into my mouth.I never said rape isnt a problem.,0
"Ok, thats my thinking too. If [NAME] really only gets 180 anyone who didn't make that deal (like us) is pretty dang foolish.",0
I'll look into it! I don't mind language but misogyny can be pretty intolerable,0
"You can't post a Sons pic and then say ""I got this"", that just hurts.",0
Every day in everyway. If I am to happy with anything next thing I know I'm actively destroying it.,0

I‚Äôm just worried about his attitude and approach with younger players. Edit-re worded,0
"No, I have been avoiding doing anything until it's actually fixed because I don't want to give them any reason to drag their feet.",0
You should be embarrassed. Not only because you are a adulterer but because you are a pedo for thinking of your son.,0
They don‚Äôt like to be excluded from anything,0
One of my worst nightmares. Ugh.,0
Don't kink shame,0
My wife is divorcing me because I glued [NAME] face onto all of our family photos He looks good with her body,0
Your point? That doesn't mean it had 2 of EVERY FREAKING LAND MAMMAL on it!,0
"Have nobody thought of the giant tech corporation selling overpriced, inferior products to sheep customers? That's odd.",0
My poor space bar takes an awful bashing with all the pausing in a Squidge vid,0
"Every time I get a staff kill, it feels like seeing a shooting star <3 Yeah, it definitely sucks.",0
I hate these memes because [NAME] never cared if he did or didn't have a nose.,0
Honestly you should have gone nuclear on him,0
Wow he is... ugly.,0
"He's always had the tools to do this, which is why he can be frustrating at times.",0
"Welp , that statement is not very wrong.",0
100%. Please ignore him. He's annoying af and survives off attention,0
We're not exactly short on white homophobes either though.,0
Of course he will lie cheat and steal to make him self relevant to the public. Horrible person.,0
[NAME] is a hungry little bastard.,0
It‚Äôs not satisfying at all. If this wasn‚Äôt [NAME] it wouldn‚Äôt be popular. Interesting timing considering the [NAME] debacle too.,0
No way society should pay for your child when you are perfectly capable.,0
"And there you have it, the left who argue with personal attacks and cnn buzzwords.",0

"By law, China must accept the South China Sea ruling, period. Stop trying to help China weasel out of it.",0
No because to them this disabled boy is faceless. It‚Äôs easier to digest our hate and vitriol without thinking about it.,0
Fucking hell they're bringing on all the giants,0
Definitely fake. Looks like bad CGI in a movie.,0
Me me big sad.,0

This makes me want to get nipple piercings but I‚Äôm too scared to :/,0
Love the gif but I bloody hate these kinds of captions. It's as annoying and cringey as a fully grown adult doing baby-talk.,0
That's not what is being contested here. Telling your kid something like this would certainly make you a bitch.,0
80% of the country is putting their faith in a man who doesn‚Äôt even have personal awareness of where he is.,0

That doesn‚Äôt seem like very responsible presentation of findings.,0
"Nope, not a [NAME] fan at all.",0
"I know they are treated very well, but some of them do die.",0
These memes are either on a 9gag level or r/funny levels of comedy. And I can't tell which is worse.,0

It doesn‚Äôt look cool,0
"Sorry, new at",0
"Sorry for the bad analogy, yours is way better",0
"I apologize, that sincerely was meant for Askreddit. If you look at my history you'll see that's where I always post. My mistake.",0
Well 216 is out now and Im crying. [NAME] why?,0
They are so old and so predictable that they can NOT see how ‚Äúsilly‚Äù they look when they post articles like this......,0
Then I‚Äôm sorry but this game really isn‚Äôt for you. Progression like that would ruin the base of what this game is.,0
