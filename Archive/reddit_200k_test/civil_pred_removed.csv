As an American, I welcome all migrants who want to be port of or work with this country in a positive way.

It has nothing to do with religion, nothing to do with color or race, nothing to do with the color blue or anything else. The policy is about vetting individuals to ensure they do cause harm to America.

I had a colleague killed in the San Bernardino shooting. My wife an I had a good friend who died in the World Trade Center attack on 9-11. When you've been touched by these tragedies you do understand why such a policy is needed.

Please do not feel unwelcome in America. We take everyone, unless you present a danger to the country or its people. 

In fact, I am completely in favor of Globalization once we can ensure people will assimilate into all countries (not just America) peacefully. Until then, we have to protect ourselves and our citizens from those who would seek to do us harm.

I'm a good looking guy. When I was in my twenties dating was easy. Super easy for me to get dates, have adult fun with women. 

Now I'm in my mid 30's and dating is a nightmare. Ever since I turned 30, EVERY single woman I've dated has made at least 10k more than me. I was pulling in 57k and it still wasn't enough to escape the relationship killer of not being enough for her. 

I'm currently working in Finance and most often wear a suit. I cannot stress enough the immense difference between a year ago me and the me today in relation to how women treat me. 

A year ago, making 57k in IT, women were not impressed at all. Dating was ""ok"" social status wise. I'm sure I could find a smart, attractive, and reasonably emotionally developed woman making this much. She would be hard to find though, because she would have to see the value of my personality being greater than my paycheck. 

Now I make more money. I look it too. My job title sounds like money. There is *immediate* interest in my work and the attention span of my dates is greater. I've noticed I can even be more brash on dates and still have better reactions than being a gentleman.
